# CVIDB

The CVIDB test set comprises a total of 1233 single-choice questions and 203 multiple-choice questions. Each question in this standard test set includes detailed explanations to provide insights into the reasoning behind the correct answers, thereby enhancing the learning and understanding of complex topics. The standard test set developed in this study encompasses various subtypes of cardiovascular diseases, different stages of disease progression, as well as related complications and comorbidities. This test set effectively evaluates the depth and breadth of large language models' understanding of the full spectrum of cardiovascular diseases.

The CVIDB benchmark test set designed and constructed in this study has been publicly released on the GitHub platform, available for free download and use by researchers and developers. This test set aims to provide a standardized, high-quality data resource and evaluation tool to assess the performance of large language models in cardiovascular disease diagnosis tasks.
