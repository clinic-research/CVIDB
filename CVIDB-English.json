        "Explanation": "The feedback information sent by the controlled part adjusts the activity of the controlled part, eventually causing the controlled part to change in the opposite direction to its original activity, which is called negative feedback. The decompression reflex (baroreceptor reflex) is a typical negative feedback regulation (pair B): when arterial blood pressure rises, the incoming impulses from baroreceptors increase, causing the baroreceptor reflex to strengthen, resulting in strengthening of the cardiovagus nerve, cardiac sympathetic tension and sympathetic vasoconstriction. Tension weakens, manifested by slowed heart rate, reduced cardiac output, reduced peripheral resistance, and decreased arterial blood pressure (P131-P132). Blood coagulation (P73) (D is wrong), urinary reflex (P254) (A is wrong), defecation reflex (E is wrong), delivery process (P416) (C is wrong), etc. are all positive feedback regulation processes.",

        "Option E": "When the average blood pressure rises and falls within a certain range, renal blood flow remains relatively constant",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "There are three ways the body regulates various physiological functional activities: neural regulation, humoral regulation and autoregulation. Autoregulation refers to an adaptive response of tissue cells to environmental stimuli that does not depend on nerve or humoral factors. Many physiological functional activities of the body involve autoregulation: such as myogenic autoregulation (E pair) and tube-tubule feedback to regulate renal blood flow, osmotic diuresis and bulb-tubule balance in the process of urine production (P240), local Metabolic autoregulation of tissues (P141), myogenic autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (P140), heterologous autoregulation of cardiac and skeletal muscles (P91), and a large number of autoregulations present in the endocrine system, etc. However, so far only the myogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow (1992N65A, 1999N1A) and the myogenic autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (2012N121B) have been examined. Apnea after hyperventilation occurs because during hyperventilation, pulmonary ventilation increases, exhaled CO₂ increases, PCO₂ in the blood decreases, and the respiratory center is inhibited due to lack of sufficient CO₂ stimulation. It is a chemical receptor-mediated nerve Adjustment (A is wrong). Arterial blood pressure remains relatively constant, mainly related to the baroreceptor reflex of the cardiovascular system, which is a typical neural regulation (B error). Maintaining a relatively constant body temperature depends on skin blood flow, sweating, changes in metabolic levels, etc. under the control of the thermoregulatory center, which is also a typical neuroregulation (C is wrong). The most important factor in maintaining a constant blood sugar level is insulin. The regulation of blood sugar by insulin belongs to humoral regulation (D is wrong).",

        "Explanation": "Increased peripheral arterial pressure (pair E) can lead to acute left ventricular insufficiency. This is due to the increase in left ventricular afterload and the inability of myocardial contractility to increase accordingly, resulting in a decrease in left heart ejection volume and inability to meet the metabolic needs of the body's tissues. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (Error A), increased pulmonary venous pressure (Error B), and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (Error D) are pathophysiological changes of acute left ventricular insufficiency.

        "Option B": "A small amount of Ca²⁺ flows in, triggering the release of Ca²+ from the terminal pool",
        "Option C": "No Ca²⁺ flows across the cell membrane, the channel is allosteric to release Ca²⁺ from the terminal cisternae",
        "Option D": "Massive Ca²⁺ efflux, causing muscle relaxation",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "There are two types of myotube systems in striated muscle cells (skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes): transverse tubes and longitudinal tubes. There are L-type calcium channels on the membrane of the transverse tube (or T-tube). The longitudinal tube (or L tube) is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is divided into the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (LSR) and the connecting sarcoplasmic reticulum (or terminal cistern) (JSR). There is calcium on the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Pump, there are calcium release channels connected to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (the terminal cistern connected to the sarcoplasmic reticulum contains high concentrations of Ca2+), and the distribution of calcium release channels corresponds to the L-type calcium channels on the transversal membrane or sarcolemma. The above is the structural basis of the excitation-contraction coupling of striated muscle cells. The following are the basic steps of the excitation-contraction coupling of striated muscle cells: ① Action potential conduction in the transverse canal membrane: The action potential on the sarcolemma is transmitted along the transverse canal membrane to the interior of the muscle cell, and activates the L-type in the transverse canal membrane and sarcolemma. Calcium channel; ② Ca2+ release in the terminal pool: Ca2+ in the terminal pool is released into the cytoplasm through two different mechanisms in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle (see Figure 2-32 on P52). In skeletal muscle, the calcium release mechanism is triggered through conformational changes. This This triggering mechanism has no Ca2+ flow across the cell membrane (C pair). In the myocardium, calcium triggers the calcium release mechanism. This triggering mechanism relies on a small amount of Ca2+ influx (B pair), through Ca2+ and the calcium binding site in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Binding causes calcium release channels to open. ③Ca2+ triggers myofilament sliding: The increase in Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm prompts Ca2+ to combine with TnC to trigger muscle contraction; ④Sarcoplasmic reticulum reabsorbs Ca2+: The increased Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is absorbed by the calcium in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (LSR) pump and be taken back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.",

        "Option C": "The K⁺ conductance of the membrane increases",
        "Option D": "Increased driving force of Na⁺ inflow",
        "Option E": "The negative value of K⁺ equilibrium potential decreases",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When the K⁺ concentration in the extracellular fluid decreases, the intracellular K⁺ outflow increases, and the negative value of the K⁺ equilibrium potential increases (or the absolute value increases) (E error), because the resting membrane potential of the cell is approximately equal to the K⁺ equilibrium potential, so the negative value of the membrane potential also increases (B error), the negative value of the membrane potential increases, and the inward driving force Na⁺ receives as a positive charge also increases (D pair). Changes in extracellular K⁺ concentration only affect the conductance of inward rectifying potassium channels, and inward rectifying potassium channels exist on the myocardial cell membrane. Ungated potassium channels in skeletal muscles and nerve cells are not affected by a decrease in extracellular K⁺ concentration. Therefore, cells A significant decrease in external K⁺ concentration also has different effects on the two types of cells: for cardiomyocytes, during hypokalemia, K⁺ permeability decreases and K⁺ conductance decreases; for nerve cells and skeletal muscle cells , during hypokalemia, the cell membrane becomes hyperpolarized and the K⁺ conductance remains unchanged (C is wrong). When the K⁺ concentration of the extracellular fluid increases, the Na⁺-K⁺ pump is activated and the transport of Na⁺ to the extracellular fluid increases; conversely, when the K⁺ concentration of the extracellular fluid decreases, the Na⁺-K⁺ pump is inhibited and transports Na⁺ to the extracellular fluid. Extracellular transport of Na⁺ is reduced (A is wrong).",

        "Question": "Which of the following statements about action potentials is correct?",

        "Option B": "After the stimulation intensity reaches the threshold, increasing the stimulation intensity can increase the action potential amplitude.",

        "Option E": "In different excitable cells, the amplitude and duration of action potentials are different.",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The action potential has the characteristics of \"all or nothing\", that is, it either reaches the maximum value (all) or does not occur (none). When the stimulation intensity is lower than the threshold, no action potential (none) is generated, but a local potential (A error) is generated. ), when the stimulation intensity reaches the threshold, the action potential amplitude reaches the maximum value (full) and does not increase as the stimulation intensity increases (B error). Due to the \"all or none\" characteristics of the action potential, it does not increase during the conduction process. It will become smaller as the conduction distance increases (D is wrong). Different cells have different amplitudes and durations of action potentials. For example, the action potential duration of nerve cells is very short, and the spike lasts only 1 ms, while the action potential duration of ventricular myocytes is longer, up to about 300 ms. During this period, the action potential is formed A plateau (E pair). The seventh edition of physiology believed that the spread of action potentials is based on electrotonicity, but the ninth edition of physiology pointed out that the spread of action potentials can be explained by the local current theory, that is, local current flows from the excited area to the unexcited area in the membrane, towards the non-excited area. After passing through the cell membrane, it returns to the excited zone and forms a current loop. During this process, the propagation of action potential does not attenuate, while the electrotonic spread has a small range and is easy to attenuate. It belongs to the conduction mode of local potential (C error). It should be noted here that \"local current\" and \"local potential\" are not the same concept. Local current is the propagation method of action potential, and local potential is a form of potential that is different from action potential.",

        "Option D": "Ca²⁺ inflow, K⁺ outflow",
        "Option E": "K⁺ flows in, Ca²⁺ flows out",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The plateau phase is the second phase of the action potential. It is named because the repolarization speed is extremely slow and the membrane potential almost stagnates at the same level to form a plateau. The existence of the plateau phase is the main reason for the long duration of ventricular myocyte action potentials, and is also the main feature that distinguishes it from nerve and skeletal muscle action potentials. The reason why the repolarization speed is slow during the plateau period is because the repolarization process involves both outward and inward currents. The outward current is the delayed rectifier potassium current mediated by the Ik channel, and the inward current is the L mediated by the ICa-L channel. type calcium current (D pair). Note: Among the outward currents, the textbook also mentions the inward rectifying potassium current mediated by the Ik₁ channel. The characteristic of the Ik₁ channel is that it only has greater permeability at the resting potential level or in the hyperpolarized state, while in the de-energized state The permeability is low in the polarized state, and the plateau is in a depolarized state. Therefore, the inward rectifier potassium current mediated by the Ik₁ channel does not participate in the repolarization process in the plateau, which is also the reason why the plateau lasts longer. important reason.",

        "Option C": "ventricular systole",
        "Option D": "ventricular diastole",
        "Option E": "Ventricular systole + isovolumic relaxation",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The closing and opening of the atrioventricular valves are related to the activity cycle of the ventricles. The activity cycle of the ventricle includes systole and diastole. The systole period can be divided into isovolumetric contraction period and ejection period. The ejection period can be divided into rapid ejection period and slowed ejection period. The diastolic period can be divided into isovolumetric contraction period and ejection period. The ventricular filling phase can be divided into rapid filling phase, slow filling phase and atrial systole phase. Atrioventricular valve closure begins in the isovolumetric contraction phase: after the ventricle begins to contract, the intraventricular pressure immediately rises. When the intraventricular pressure rises above the intraatrial pressure, the atrioventricular valve can be pushed to close, so the blood will not flow out. into the atrium. However, at this time, the intraventricular pressure is still lower than the aortic pressure, so the semilunar valve is still closed, and the ventricle temporarily becomes a closed heart chamber. During the period from the closure of the atrioventricular valve to the opening of the aortic valve, the contraction of the ventricle cannot be changed. The volume of the ventricles is called isovolumetric contraction. The isovolumic contraction phase is followed by the ejection phase: when the ventricular contraction increases the intraventricular pressure to exceed the aortic pressure, the semilunar valve opens, which marks the end of the isovolumetric contraction phase and the ejection phase. During the entire ejection phase, the atrioventricular valves are is closed to prevent blood from flowing from the ventricles into the atria. The ejection period is followed by the isovolumic diastole period: after ejection, the ventricle begins to relax, the intraventricular pressure drops, and the blood in the aorta regurgitates toward the ventricle, pushing the semilunar valve to close; but at this time, the intraventricular pressure is still higher than the intraatrial pressure. Therefore, the atrioventricular valve is still closed, and the ventricle temporarily becomes a closed heart chamber. During the period from the closing of the semilunar valve to the opening of the atrioventricular valve, the ventricle relaxes without changing the volume of the ventricle, so it is called isovolumetric. diastole. The isovolumetric diastole phase is followed by a rapid filling phase: when the intraventricular pressure drops below the intraatrial pressure, blood breaks through the atrioventricular valves and enters the ventricles, and the ventricles begin to fill. Therefore, from the isovolumic systole, ejection phase to isovolumic relaxation, the atrioventricular valves are closed, that is, the time from atrioventricular valve closure to opening is approximately equivalent to ventricular systole + isovolumic relaxation (E pair).",

        "Option E": "relative refractory period",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "When nerve cells are effectively stimulated, Na⁺ channels are activated. The inflow of Na⁺ causes the depolarization of the cells, causing the membrane potential to rise sharply, forming the rising phase of the action potential. A large number of Na⁺ channels are activated, causing the depolarization potential to reach its peak. , Na⁺ permeability decreases rapidly, Na⁺ channels are gradually inactivated, Na⁺ inflow decreases, while K⁺ permeability gradually increases, K⁺ channel opening increases, K⁺ outflow increases, and the cell membrane rapidly repolarizes, forming Falling phase of the action potential (pair B). Overshoot is the part where the cell membrane potential is higher than zero potential, including both the rising phase of part of the action potential and the falling phase of part of the action potential, including both the activation of Na⁺ channels and the inactivation of Na⁺ channels (pair C). During the absolute refractory period, most Na⁺ channels have entered an inactivated state (D pair), the cell excitability is zero, and it is impossible to be activated by stimulation again. During the relative refractory period, although the inactivated voltage-gated sodium channels have begun to resurrect, the number of reactivated channels is small and some are still inactive (pair E). Therefore, for nerve fibers, Na⁺ channel inactivation exists in all BCDE options, but the correct answer to this question is only B. It is worth noting that option A of this question is also correct for cardiomyocytes, because the INa channel that mediates depolarization of cardiomyocytes is a fast channel. It not only activates quickly, but also inactivates quickly after activation. When When the membrane is depolarized to a certain extent (around 0mV) (still in the rising phase of the action potential), the INa channel begins to inactivate and close, finally terminating INa (P99).",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "During the cardiac cycle, the atria and ventricles carry out activities in a certain order and time course, and then produce four heart sounds in sequence. After the ventricle begins to contract, the pressure in the ventricle increases. When the intraventricular pressure rises to exceed the intraatrial pressure, the atrioventricular valve closes, causing the blood in the ventricle and the ventricular wall to vibrate, and the first heart sound is produced. At this time, the semilunar valve is still closed. state, the period from the closure of the atrioventricular valve to the opening of the aortic valve, the contraction of the ventricle cannot change the volume of the ventricle, which is called the isovolumic contraction period (A pair); when the intraventricular pressure rises to exceed the aortic pressure for half a month The valve opens, and the cardiac cycle enters the ejection phase. In the early stage of ejection, the ventricle injects a larger amount of blood into the aorta, and the blood flow rate is also very fast, which is called the rapid ejection stage (C error); in the later stage of ejection, The strength of ventricular contraction weakens, and the speed of ejection gradually slows down, so it is called the slowed ejection period (D error); after the completion of ventricular ejection, the ventricle begins to relax, the semilunar valve closes, and a second heart sound is formed. At this time, the atrioventricular valve In the closed state, during the period from the closure of the semilunar valve to the opening of the atrioventricular valve, the ventricle relaxes without changing the volume of the ventricle, which is the isovolumic diastole period (B error). In the cardiac cycle, the four heart sounds appear sequentially during the isovolumic contraction phase, isovolumic relaxation phase, rapid filling phase and atrial systole phase.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "After ejection, the ventricle begins to relax, the intraventricular pressure drops, and the blood in the aorta regurgitates toward the ventricle, pushing the aortic valve (semilunar valve) to close (D pair), but at this time the intraventricular pressure is still higher than the intraatrial pressure. , so the atrioventricular valve is still closed, and the ventricle is temporarily a closed cavity. During the period from the closure of the aortic valve to the opening of the atrioventricular valve, the ventricle relaxes without changing the ventricular volume, which is called the isovolumic diastole period. Therefore, the time when the aortic valve closes is the beginning of the isovolumic diastole period (D pair). At the end of atrial systole, the atrioventricular valve closes (error A); at the beginning of rapid ejection (error B), the aortic valve opens; at the beginning of slow ejection (error C), the intraventricular pressure is lower than the aortic pressure, but at this time the heart Because the blood in the chamber has high kinetic energy, it can still reversibly pressure gradient and continue to enter the aorta, so the aortic valve is still open.",

        "Explanation": "The ventricular pressure-volume curve is drawn from the ventricular pressure and volume values at each corresponding time point. Connecting the various points can produce a ventricular pressure-volume loop, which represents the ventricular pressure-volume relationship throughout the cardiac cycle. This loop Changes can be used to reflect preload, afterload, ventricular compliance, and myocardial contractility. The expansion of the ventricular pressure-volume loop to the left reflects the increase in myocardial contractility; the expansion of the ventricular pressure-volume loop to the right reflects an increase in preload (error A); the upward expansion of the ventricular pressure-volume loop reflects an increase in afterload (error B); The narrowing of the ventricular pressure-volume loop reflects reduced myocardial compliance (C error). The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship curve can reflect the ventricular contractility. An increase in the slope of the curve reflects an increase in the ventricular contractility, and a decrease in the slope of the curve reflects a weakening of the ventricular contractility.

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Isometric adjustment refers to an adjustment method in which muscle length remains unchanged but contractile capacity increases (pair A). Catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine), calcium sensitizers (such as theophylline), thyroid hormones, etc. can enhance the contractility of the myocardium through various mechanisms and perform isometric regulation. The adjustment method corresponding to isometric adjustment is allometric adjustment. Allometric adjustment refers to the adjustment method that affects myocardial contractility by changing the initial length of myocardial cells. The increase in the initial length of sarcomeres and the increase in ventricular end-diastolic volume all involve the myocardium. The change in the initial length of the cell is due to heterolength regulation (BD is wrong). The change in the initial length of myocardial cells essentially changes the number of cross-bridge connections between thick and thin myofilaments, so the number of cross-bridge connections between thick and thin myofilaments is also the cause of heterolength regulation (C is wrong).",

        "Explanation": "Heparin was first discovered in the liver and is named after it. It is mainly produced by mast cells and basophils. Heparin has a strong anticoagulant effect, but in the absence of antithrombin (previously called antithrombin III) , the anticoagulant effect of heparin is very weak. Heparin mainly exerts its anticoagulant effect indirectly by enhancing the activity of antithrombin (pair B). The latter is a serine protease inhibitor that can interact with thrombin and thrombin produced by the endogenous coagulation pathway. The serine residues in the active centers of molecules such as FⅨa, FⅩa, FⅪa and FⅫa bind to inhibit their activity. After combining with heparin, their anticoagulant effect can be enhanced by more than 2000 times. However, under normal circumstances, there is almost no heparin in circulating plasma, and antithrombin enhances the anticoagulant function of vascular endothelium mainly by binding to heparan sulfate on the surface of endothelial cells.",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When a muscle receives a series of consecutive excitatory impulses with short intervals between each other, due to the short time interval between each stimulus, the latter stimulus falls before the contraction caused by the previous stimulus has ended, causing the next contraction. Called tonic contraction. Tetanic contractions include two types: complete tetanic contractions and incomplete tetanic contractions. When the stimulation frequency is relatively high, the contraction caused by the latter stimulus falls within the contraction period of the previous contraction, and the muscle will always maintain a contracted state. This phenomenon is called Full tetanic contraction. When the stimulation frequency is relatively low, the contraction caused by the latter stimulation falls within the diastolic period of the previous contraction. The muscle relaxes briefly after the contraction, but it does not return to the normal diastolic state before entering the next contraction. This kind of The phenomenon is called incomplete tetanic contraction. Skeletal muscle cells can produce either complete tetanic contractions or incomplete tetanic contractions. Myocardial cells will not undergo complete tetanic contractions due to their particularly long effective refractory period (C pair), which extends into the early diastole of myocardial contractile activity.",

        "Option E": "cardiac output",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When the heart rate decreases, the ventricular diastolic period is prolonged, so the blood volume flowing from the aorta to the periphery increases during diastole, and the blood volume remaining in the aorta decreases, resulting in a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (B error). As the blood volume retained in the aorta at the end of diastole decreases, the blood volume in the arteries decreases during systole, and the systolic blood pressure also decreases accordingly (False A). However, the size of systolic blood pressure is mainly affected by the stroke volume of the heart. Stroke volume remains unchanged, so the decrease in systolic blood pressure is not as significant as the decrease in diastolic blood pressure, so the pulse pressure increases (pair D). Mean arterial pressure refers to the average arterial blood pressure at each moment in a cardiac cycle. Since the systolic blood pressure representing the highest blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure representing the lowest blood pressure both decrease, the mean arterial pressure also decreases (C wrong).

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The cardiac vagus nerve plays a negative chronotropic effect, a negative inotropic effect, and a negative inotropic conduction effect on the heart. When the conduction of the cardiac vagus nerve is blocked, cardiac contractility is enhanced (mainly atrium), heart rate is accelerated, and thus cardiac output (cardiac output) Output volume = stroke volume × heart rate) increases (A is wrong). The cardiac sympathetic nerves play a positive chronotropic effect, a positive inotropic effect, and a positive inotropic conduction effect on the heart. When the cardiac sympathetic nerves are stimulated, the cardiac contractility is enhanced, the heart rate is accelerated, and the cardiac output is increased (B error). The pressure in the carotid sinus decreases, the incoming impulses from the baroreceptors decrease, and the baroreceptor reflex weakens, which increases the tone of the sympathetic nerve, causing the heart rate to increase and the cardiac output to increase (C wrong). The increase in end-diastolic volume, that is, the increase in preload, strengthens cardiac contractility through heterometric adjustment, increases stroke volume, and then increases cardiac output (D is wrong). When changing from a supine position to a standing position, the effect of gravity increases the transmural pressure, venous filling and expansion, the return volume of blood to the heart decreases, and the preload decreases. Through the adjustment of different lengths, the cardiac contractility is weakened, and the stroke volume is reduced. Finally, Decreased cardiac output (pair E).",

        "Explanation": "Atrial flutter, referred to as atrial flutter, is a tachyarrhythmia between atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. It is rare in healthy people and most patients have structural heart disease. Cardioversion refers to using an external high-energy pulse current to pass through the heart in severe tachyarrhythmias, causing all or most of the myocardial cells to depolarize simultaneously in an instant, causing a brief cessation of the heart's electrical activity, and then the heart's highest automaticity. A treatment in which the pacemaker (usually the sinoatrial node) re-directs the heart's rhythm. When atrial flutter occurs, atrial flutter can be quickly converted to sinus rhythm through direct current cardioversion (B pair). Cedilan (wrong A) is a digitalis preparation that can slow down atrioventricular conduction, increase covert conduction in the atrioventricular node, and slow down ventricular rate by stimulating the vagus nerve.

In the compensatory phase of patients with ventricular hypofunction, myocardial cells undergo compensatory hypertrophy (myocardial cells are permanent cells. During the compensatory phase, only hypertrophy occurs with an increase in cell volume, but no hyperplasia with an increase in cell number). The myocardial contractility is enhanced, making each Stroke volume (False D) and volume per minute (False A) are not significantly different from normal people. Therefore, compensatory hypertrophy of myocardial cells itself is beneficial to improving the ejection fraction of patients with ventricular hypofunction (False C). Because in patients with ventricular hypofunction, ventricular ejection capacity decreases in the early stage and residual blood volume increases at the end of systole, resulting in abnormal expansion of the ventricular cavity (pair B). The expansion of the ventricular cavity will lead to an increase in the ventricular end-diastolic volume, causing a significant decrease in ejection fraction.",

Each waveform of the electrocardiogram reflects the depolarization or repolarization process in different parts of the heart. The sinus node is located on the epicardium of the right atrium, and the activation of the sinus node is first conducted to the right atrium and then to the left atrium through the interatrial bundle. During this transduction process, the left and right atrial myocytes are activated, complete the depolarization process, generate an obvious integrated potential, and form the P wave (B pair) that can be recorded on the electrocardiogram, while the sinoatrial node and interatrial bundle depolarize The integrated potential generated during the process is very small and cannot be recorded on the surface electrocardiogram (AC error).

The decrease in arterial blood pressure reduces the incoming impulses from baroreceptors and weakens the baroreceptor reflex. This leads to increased cardiac sympathetic nerve tension and increased heart rate (pair C). Acute blood loss will lead to blood redistribution. In order to ensure the blood supply to important organs, the skin blood vessels shrink and the blood supply is reduced, so the skin appears pale and clammy (E pair).

When the heart's ejection capacity is strengthened, the heart can promptly inject the blood returning to the heart into the arteries, reducing central venous pressure (A error) and promoting peripheral venous blood return. When the body position changes from upright to supine, the veins in the low-hanging part of the body can contract due to the decrease in transmural pressure, increase the blood return volume, and increase the central venous pressure (pair B). When you change from walking to standing, the squeezing effect of skeletal muscles on the veins within and between muscles weakens, the venous return slows down, the amount of blood returned to the heart is relatively reduced, and the central venous pressure decreases (C is wrong). When inhaling, the thoracic cavity volume increases and the negative pressure in the pleural cavity increases, which causes the large veins and right atrium in the thoracic cavity to expand further, and the central venous pressure decreases, which facilitates the return of peripheral venous blood to the right atrium; on the contrary, when exhaling, The negative pressure in the pleural cavity decreases, the large veins and right atrium in the thoracic cavity contract, and the central venous pressure increases, which is not conducive to peripheral venous return.

The veins in the lower limbs and other low-hanging parts of the body expand due to the increase in transmural pressure and can accommodate more blood. The amount of blood returned to the heart by the veins decreases. Insufficient blood supply to the brain leads to fainting (pair A).",

In the heart, after epinephrine binds to β₁ receptors, it can enhance myocardial contractility (A pair), accelerate heart rate (B pair), and produce positive inotropic and positive chronotropic effects. In blood vessels, the effect of epinephrine depends on the distribution of α and β₂ receptors on vascular smooth muscle: α receptors are dominant in number on the skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal, and vascular smooth muscles, and adrenaline can constrict the blood vessels of these organs. . β₂ receptors are dominant on the blood vessels of skeletal muscles and liver (but α receptors are also distributed). Small doses of epinephrine often have the main effect of stimulating β₂ receptors, causing vasodilation, while large doses cause vasodilation due to α receptors. The body is also excited, thus causing vasoconstriction. The correct answer to this question is D. Since large doses of epinephrine can constrict skeletal muscle blood vessels, the answer to this question is not rigorous.",

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The baroreceptor reflex, also called the decompression reflex, is induced by stimulation of baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. The appropriate stimulation of carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptors is passive mechanical dilation of the vessel wall rather than blood pressure per se (pair A). When arterial blood pressure rises, the incoming impulses from baroreceptors increase. Through the integration of related cardiovascular centers, cardiac vagal tone is strengthened, cardiac sympathetic tone and sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone are reduced. The effects are slowing of heart rate and reduction of cardiac output. Peripheral vascular resistance decreases, so arterial blood pressure falls back (pair C). The baroreceptor reflex plays an important role in the rapid regulation of arterial blood pressure under sudden changes in cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, blood volume, etc. (D pair). The afferent nerves of the carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptors are the sinus nerve and the aortic nerve (B pair) respectively. After the afferent nerve is cut off, the arterial blood pressure will become unstable (when the blood pressure rises, it cannot lower the blood pressure, and when the blood pressure drops, cannot increase blood pressure), but the average blood pressure throughout the day does not increase (E is wrong, the correct answer to this question).",

Therefore, arterial blood pressure is the afterload encountered during ventricular contraction. An increase in arterial blood pressure means an increase in afterload. When the afterload increases, the time for the ventricle to start ejection is prolonged, and the time for the ventricle to reach the highest ventricular pressure during ejection (the intraventricular pressure is the highest at the end of the rapid ejection period, see 2003N93B) is also prolonged accordingly (wrong D) .",

        "Option E": "Arterial and venous ends of capillaries",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When the blood ejected from the left ventricle flows through the peripheral blood vessels, it consumes energy due to constantly overcoming the resistance of the blood vessels to blood flow, and the blood pressure gradually decreases. The decrease in blood pressure in each segment of a blood vessel is proportional to the resistance of that segment to blood flow. In the aorta and large arteries, the blood pressure drops less. When it reaches the small arteries, the blood flow resistance increases and the blood pressure drops also becomes larger. In the systemic circulation, the arteriole segment has the greatest blood flow resistance and the most significant decrease in blood pressure. Among the options, only the femoral artery → femoral vein (pair C) and the pulmonary artery → left atrium (wrong D) flow through the arterioles, so options A, B, and E are eliminated first. Since the pulmonary artery pressure is only 1/6 of the aortic pressure (P88), the blood pressure drop in the pulmonary circulation is much smaller than that in the systemic circulation, so the blood pressure difference from the femoral artery to the femoral vein is greater than the blood pressure difference from the pulmonary artery to the left atrium (pair C).",

        "Option D": "peripheral resistance",
        "Option E": "cardiac output",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The systolic blood pressure of a normal person's systemic circulation is 100-120mmHg, the diastolic blood pressure is 60-80mmHg, and the pulse pressure is 30-40mmHg; while the average systolic blood pressure of the pulmonary circulation is about 22mmHg, the diastolic blood pressure is 0-1mmHg, and the pulse pressure is 21-22mmHg (systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure). pressure). Therefore, the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure of the systemic circulation are much greater than those of the pulmonary circulation (ABC is wrong). The wall of the pulmonary artery is thinner than that of the aorta, and the pulmonary artery is in a negative thoracic pressure environment. The negative thoracic pressure is conducive to the expansion of the pulmonary artery, so the peripheral resistance of the pulmonary circulation is lower than that of the systemic circulation (D is wrong). Blood is ejected from the left ventricle, flows back to the right atrium through the systemic circulation, and then is ejected from the right ventricle and enters the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, the systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation are connected, so the amount of blood flowing through per unit time is the same, that is, the cardiac output is the same ( E right).",

        "Explanation": "Within a certain range, increased heart rate can increase cardiac output. When the heart rate increases but does not exceed a certain limit, although the ventricular filling time is shortened at this time, since most of the venous return blood enters the ventricle during the rapid filling period, the ventricular filling volume and stroke volume will not be significantly reduced. , and the increase in heart rate can significantly increase the output per minute. However, if the heart rate is too fast, when it exceeds 160 to 180 beats per minute, the ventricular diastole (filling period) will be significantly shortened (pair A), the diastolic filling volume will be significantly reduced, and therefore the stroke volume will be significantly reduced, resulting in Decreased cardiac output.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Isometric adjustment refers to an adjustment method in which muscle length remains unchanged but contractile capacity increases (pair D). Catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine), calcium sensitizers (such as theophylline), thyroid hormones, etc. can enhance the contractility of the myocardium through various mechanisms and perform isometric regulation. The adjustment method corresponding to isometric adjustment is allometric adjustment. Allometric adjustment refers to the adjustment method that affects the contractility of myocardium by changing the initial length of myocardial cells. The initial length of myocardium, the initial length of sarcomeres, and the end-diastolic volume of the ventricle are all involved. The change in the initial length of myocardial cells is the cause of heterolength regulation (ABE error). The change in the initial length of cardiomyocytes essentially changes the number of cross-bridge combinations between thick and thin myofilaments, so the number of cross-bridge combinations between thick and thin myofilaments is also the cause of heterolength regulation (C is wrong).",

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "When the heart rate slows down, the diastolic period of the ventricle is prolonged, so the amount of blood flowing from the aorta to the periphery increases during diastole, and the amount of blood remaining in the aorta decreases, resulting in a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (A is wrong). As the blood volume retained in the aorta at the end of diastole decreases, the blood volume in the artery decreases during systole, and the systolic blood pressure also decreases accordingly (B error). However, the size of systolic blood pressure is mainly affected by the stroke volume of the heart. Stroke volume remains unchanged, so the decrease in systolic blood pressure is not as significant as the decrease in diastolic blood pressure, so the pulse pressure increases (pair E). Mean arterial pressure refers to the average arterial blood pressure at each moment in a cardiac cycle. Since the systolic blood pressure representing the highest blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure representing the lowest blood pressure both decrease, the mean arterial pressure also decreases (C wrong).

        "Explanation": "The plateau phase is the second phase of the action potential. It is named because the repolarization speed is extremely slow and the membrane potential almost stagnates at the same level to form a plateau. The existence of the plateau phase is the main reason for the long duration of ventricular myocyte action potentials, and is also the main feature that distinguishes it from nerve and skeletal muscle action potentials. The reason why the repolarization speed is slow during the plateau period is because the repolarization process involves both outward and inward currents. The outward current is the delayed rectifier potassium current mediated by the Ik channel, and the inward current is the L mediated by the ICa-L channel. type calcium current (D pair). Note: Among the outward currents, the textbook also mentions the inward rectifying potassium current mediated by the Ik₁ channel. The characteristic of the Ik₁ channel is that it only has greater permeability at the resting potential level or in the hyperpolarized state, while in the de-energized state The permeability is low in the polarized state. Since the plateau phase is in the repolarization state, the inward rectifier potassium current mediated by the Ik₁ channel does not participate in the repolarization process of the plateau phase.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When drinking a large amount of water, the blood is diluted and the plasma crystal osmotic pressure is reduced, causing the release of antidiuretic hormone to be reduced, the reabsorption of water by the collecting duct to be reduced, the urine to be diluted, and the urine output to be increased. After drinking 1000ml of water at one time (wrong A), the urine output begins to increase about 30 minutes later, reaches the peak at the end of 1 hour, and returns to the original level after 2 to 3 hours. If you drink 1000ml of normal saline at one time (pair C), since the osmotic pressure of normal saline and plasma crystals are similar and are not easily absorbed into the blood, there will be no significant change (no significant increase) in the urine output. When drinking 1000ml of sugar water (B error) at one time, the plasma glucose concentration can exceed the renal glucose threshold. Glucose in the renal tubules cannot be completely reabsorbed. The glucose concentration in the tubular fluid increases. Due to osmosis, the concentration of water and NaCl increases. Absorption is reduced and urine output is significantly increased, a phenomenon called osmotic diuresis. A one-time intravenous injection of 1000ml of normal saline (D is wrong) can increase circulating blood volume and venous blood return to the heart, thereby stimulating cardiopulmonary receptors and inhibiting the release of antidiuretic hormone, resulting in increased urine output.

Although CO₂ retention and O₂ deficiency can deepen and accelerate respiratory movements through chemoreceptor reflexes mediated by central chemoreceptors (mainly) and peripheral chemoreceptors respectively, inducing pulmonary ventilation. However, long-term CO₂ retention has obvious adaptation to the stimulation of central chemoreceptors, while long-term low O₂ has no obvious adaptation to peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation. Therefore, patients with pulmonary heart disease mainly rely on low O₂ to stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors. Compensatory respiratory regulation.

Echocardiography is of great significance in diagnosing this disease. Typical echocardiographic findings include: significant thickening of the left ventricular wall, thicker interventricular septum than the posterior ventricular wall, small left ventricular cavity, narrow outflow tract and bicuspid systole. The prevalvular leaflets are displaced forward (D pair). Chest X-ray examination (A error) can be used as an auxiliary diagnosis basis. In typical cases, enlargement of the heart shadow and left ventricle can be seen, but there are no signs of enlargement of the ascending aorta or calcification of the valve leaflets. In advanced cases, the left atrium and right ventricle may also be enlarged, and the blood vessels in the lungs may be congested. Electrocardiogram (B error) examination can be used as an auxiliary diagnosis basis, which can show left ventricular hypertrophy and strain, and sometimes abnormal Q waves appear in anterior chest aVL and Ⅰ leads. Some cases present complete right bundle branch, left bundle branch or left anterior half branch block and left atrial hypertrophy.

        "Option E": "The presence or absence of pulmonary rales is the main clinical indicator for judging the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The floating catheter test is intubated through the veins to the pulmonary artery to measure the pressure and blood oxygen content of each part, calculate the cardiac index (CI) and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PCWP), which directly reflects the left heart function and can understand the heart function. But it cannot directly determine the area of acute myocardial infarction (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The electrocardiogram of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction may not show pathological Q waves, so the absence of pathological Q waves cannot rule out acute myocardial infarction (pair A). Right ventricular infarction is mostly caused by right coronary artery occlusion, and the right coronary artery and its branches mainly supply most of the right ventricle, the posterior wall, and the inferior wall of the left ventricle. Therefore, right ventricular infarction is often accompanied by inferior wall infarction (pair B). Early two-dimensional echocardiography can help to understand the movement of the ventricular wall and left ventricular function, and can detect complications such as ventricular aneurysms, papillary muscle dysfunction, pericardial effusion, and ventricular septal perforation, which is helpful in diagnosing myocardial infarction ( D right). Left ventricular dysfunction can lead to pulmonary congestion and edema, and pulmonary rales. Therefore, pulmonary rales are one of the main clinical indicators for judging left ventricular function (pair E).",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The hearing organ is composed of the outer ear, the middle ear, and the cochlea of the inner ear. When the outer ear and middle ear are damaged, it causes conductive deafness. When the cochlea of the inner ear, the auditory nerve, and the auditory center are damaged, it causes sensorineural deafness. The cochlear duct is centered on the bony modiolus, with the vestibular membrane on the upper side, the basilar membrane on the lower side, and the vascular stria on the outside, which contains endolymph. The basilar membrane contains auditory receptors, called spiral organs, which are composed of inner and outer hair cells and supporting cells. The top of the hair cells is in contact with the cochlear endolymph, and the bottom is in contact with the scala tympani perilymph. Inner and outer hair cells have different functions. The vascular stria on the lateral wall of the cochlear duct transfer K⁺ into the cochlear endolymph through the sodium pump and Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻. Then the mechanically gated potassium channel on the top of the inner hair cell opens, and K⁺ flows into the inner hair cell. , depolarization triggers a series of reactions, triggering the release of transmitters, which in turn causes the auditory nerve to generate impulses and conduct them. The outer hair cells act as cochlear amplifiers, sensing and quickly strengthening the vibration of the basilar membrane, thus contributing to the flow of endolymph under the tegmental membrane, making the inner hair cells more susceptible to stimulation, and increasing the sensitivity to the corresponding vibration frequency. . Clinically, furosemide inhibits the Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ symporter, preventing the formation of a high-potassium environment in the endolymph (pair C), preventing the formation of K⁺ influx, and preventing the depolarization triggering of inner hair cells. Transmitters are released and auditory nerve impulses cannot be generated, resulting in hearing impairment.",

        "Explanation": "The energy metabolism of the body complies with the law of conservation of energy. The chemical energy consumed by the body is equal to the sum of the heat energy produced and the work done externally. The body's various physiological activities, such as muscle contraction and relaxation, synthesis of tissue cell components and bioactive substances, active transmembrane transport of substances, generation of bioelectrical activities, gland secretion and transmitter release, all require the consumption of ATP or GTP, the chemical energy stored in it is eventually converted into heat energy and released. When cells synthesize various proteins, they need to consume ATP to transport various amino acids, and the energy consumed is eventually converted into heat energy. The conduction of excitement along nerve fibers requires the consumption of ATP to transport ions across the membrane. The chemical energy contained in ATP is eventually converted into heat energy and released (C error). When the heart pumps blood, most of the energy consumed to promote blood flow is converted into potential energy and kinetic energy of the blood. Due to the mutual friction between the blood and the blood vessel wall and the molecules inside the blood, this part of the energy is eventually converted into heat energy and released (A is wrong) .

        "Explanation": "Antidiuretic hormone, also known as vasopressin, is a polypeptide hormone synthesized by neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and transported to the neurohypophysis for storage through the hypothalamic-pituitary tract. Therefore, the neurohypophysis is the storage site of antidiuretic hormone. , rather than the synthetic part (A is wrong). When plasma crystalloid osmolality increases, it stimulates osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus, causing increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (pair B). When the circulating blood volume decreases, the venous return blood volume decreases, the stimulation of the cardiopulmonary receptors is weakened, the impulse transmitted to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve is reduced, and the inhibitory effect on the release of antidiuretic hormone is weakened or eliminated, so the secretion of antidiuretic hormone increases (C wrong). Antidiuretic hormone has two receptors, V₁ and V₂. The V₁ receptor is distributed in vascular smooth muscle. When activated, it can cause smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction (E error). The V₂ receptor is mainly distributed in the posterior segment of the renal distal tubule (distal convoluted tubule). ) (P245 of the ninth edition is considered to be only distributed in collecting ducts) and collecting duct epithelial cells.

The process of entering the tubular epithelial cells, then entering the interstitial fluid through the basement membrane from the tubular epithelial cells, and finally entering the blood circulation from the interstitial fluid. The most important thing is that the way and sequence of reabsorption of different substances in the proximal tubules are different. The core function of the kidney is to regulate the balance of water and salt (H₂O, Na⁺, Cl⁻) and acid-base (H⁺, HCO₃⁻). H₂O, Na⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺, and HCO₃⁻ are in the transcellular pathway of the proximal tubule. The process of reabsorption (H⁺ is secretion) is the focus and difficulty of the postgraduate entrance examination and requires focused analysis. Although transcellular pathway reabsorption includes the process of entering the tubular epithelial cells from the tubular fluid, then entering the interstitial fluid from the tubular epithelial cells, and then entering the blood circulation from the interstitial fluid, for the postgraduate entrance examination, you only need to remember the process of entering the tubular epithelial cells from the tubular fluid. Can. The process of H₂O, Na⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺, and HCO₃⁻ entering the canalicular epithelial cells can be summarized as Na⁺ → H⁺ → HCO₃⁻ → Cl⁻ → H₂O, which is similar to a relay process. Each substance plays a role in this process. Have their own functions and missions: ① In the reabsorption process of all substances, Na⁺ (E error) is at the core. First, Na⁺ in the tubular fluid enters the epithelial cells along the concentration gradient, and at the same time drives H⁺ to be secreted into the tubule fluid (mediated by the Na⁺-H⁺ exchanger in the apical membrane), that is, when Na⁺ enters the epithelial cells, it also completes the mission of taking H⁺ out of the epithelial cells; ② is brought out of the epithelial cells and into the tubule fluid H⁺ also has its own mission, which is to bring HCO₃⁻ into the epithelial cells: the H⁺ entering the tubular fluid combines with HCO₃⁻ to form H₂CO₃, and H₂CO₃ is dissociated into CO₂ and water under the catalysis of carbonic anhydrase. CO₂ enters epithelial cells by simple diffusion. In the epithelial cells, CO₂ and water form H₂CO₃ under the catalysis of carbonic anhydrase, which quickly dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻. In this way, HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ Coupling (C pair), reabsorption is completed in the form of CO₂ (B error); ③HCO₃⁻ entering epithelial cells also has its own mission, which is to bring Cl⁻ into the epithelial cells from the canalicular fluid: part HCO₃⁻ will bring Cl⁻ into epithelial cells through the exchange of Cl⁻-HCO₃⁻, and HCO₃⁻ will enter the tubular fluid again (the HCO₃⁻ that enters the tubular fluid can re-enter the epithelial cells in the form of CO₂), so HCO₃⁻ first Reabsorbed by Cl⁻ (D is wrong); ④ Na⁺, HCO₃⁻, and Cl⁻ entering epithelial cells have a common mission, which is to bring H₂O into epithelial cells as solutes: epithelial cells reabsorb Na⁺, After HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻ (including glucose, amino acids and other solutes), the osmotic pressure of the tubular fluid decreases and the osmotic pressure of the intercellular fluid increases. Under the action of this osmotic pressure difference, H₂O passes through two pathways: transcellular and paracellular. Enters the interstitial fluid and then enters the peritubular capillaries to be reabsorbed.",

        "Option B": "Physical exercise",
        "Option C": "Decreased cardiac output",
        "Option D": "anemia",
        "Option E": "CO poisoning",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Cyanide (CN⁻) can block the electron transfer process of the oxidative respiratory chain (Ninth Edition Biochemistry P133), making tissue cells unable to utilize oxygen, resulting in an increase in venous O₂ partial pressure (A pair) and venous blood turning bright red. Physical exercise increases tissue oxygen consumption, resulting in a decrease in venous O₂ partial pressure (B is wrong). When cardiac output decreases, the arterial blood flowing through the tissues decreases, and the oxygen supply per unit volume of blood flow increases, resulting in a decrease in the venous O₂ partial pressure (C is wrong). In anemia, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood is normal (the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood refers to the pressure generated by O₂ physically dissolved in arterial blood, and the O₂ physically dissolved in arterial blood comes from the direct oxygen supply of alveolar gas during pulmonary ventilation. , so the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure is normal during anemia), but the arterial blood oxygen content decreases (only 1.5% of the O₂ in the arterial blood oxygen content is transported in the form of physical dissolution, and the remaining 98.5% is in the form of chemical combination with Hb transported, the Hb content decreases during anemia, so the arterial blood oxygen content decreases). When tissue oxygen consumption does not change significantly, the venous blood oxygen content also decreases accordingly, ultimately leading to a decrease in venous O₂ partial pressure (venous blood partial pressure It refers to the pressure generated by O₂ physically dissolved in venous blood. However, the physically dissolved O₂ in venous blood comes from the dissociation of chemically bound HbO₂. The oxygen content of venous blood decreases, that is, the content of HbO₂ decreases, and the physically dissolved O₂ decreases accordingly) ( D is wrong). When arterial blood flows through tissues, physically dissolved O₂ directly supplies oxygen to the tissues, and the oxygen partial pressure decreases. The chemically bound O₂ is then dissociated, supplementing the physically dissolved O₂, increasing the blood oxygen partial pressure, and continuing to supply oxygen to the tissues. When CO is poisoned, the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure is normal (the reason is the same as the normal oxygen partial pressure in anemia), but after CO combines with one heme in the Hb molecule, it will increase the affinity of the other three hemes for O₂, hindering The dissociation of Hb and O₂ prevents the physically dissolved O₂ (the source of oxygen partial pressure) that supplies tissue oxygen from being replenished in time. When the tissue is hypoxic, the resting blood oxygen partial pressure decreases significantly (E is wrong). Summary: The sources of arterial blood oxygen partial pressure and venous blood oxygen partial pressure are different. Arterial blood oxygen partial pressure comes from alveolar gas, and venous blood oxygen partial pressure comes from oxyhemoglobin. Since the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood comes from alveolar air, as long as there are no problems with the external breathing lung ventilation process, the partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen will always be normal, regardless of the amount and functional status of hemoglobin. Since the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood comes from oxyhemoglobin, whenever there is a problem with the quantity and functional status of hemoglobin (such as anemia and CO poisoning), the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood will decrease.",

        "Explanation": "Thyroid hormone (TH) acts on almost all tissues of the body, regulating metabolism, growth and development in many aspects, and affecting organ system functions. In terms of regulating glucose metabolism, thyroid hormone can accelerate the absorption of glucose by the intestinal mucosa and promote hepatic gluconeogenesis. At the same time, it can enhance the glycogenic effects of epinephrine, glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone and increase blood sugar levels. However, thyroid hormone At the same time, it can enhance the utilization of sugar by peripheral tissues and can also lower blood sugar. However, in general, the effect of thyroid hormone on raising blood sugar is stronger than its effect on lowering blood sugar. Patients with hyperthyroidism often show impaired glucose tolerance or mild diabetes (D is wrong, this question is correct) Answer); in terms of regulating protein metabolism, excessive secretion of thyroid hormone (in patients with hyperthyroidism) can accelerate the decomposition of peripheral tissue proteins, mainly skeletal muscle, decompose bone matrix proteins, and precipitate Ca²⁺, leading to an increase in blood calcium and bone loss.

        "Explanation": "The transmitter released by most sympathetic postganglionic fibers is norepinephrine (except for the sympathetic postganglionic fibers that innervate sweat glands and skeletal muscle blood vessels that release acetylcholine). The activity of the sympathetic nervous system is related to the distribution of norepinephrine receptors on various organs. . When the sympathetic nerves are excited, they act on the β₂ receptors of the gastric smooth muscle or the α₂ and β₂ receptors of the small intestinal smooth muscle to relax the gastrointestinal smooth muscles and inhibit gastrointestinal motility (False A); the α₂ receptors of the digestive glands reduce the secretion of the digestive glands. (B is wrong); β₂ receptors acting on the detrusor muscle of the bladder cause the detrusor to relax (C is wrong); β₂ receptors acting on the bronchial smooth muscle cause the bronchial smooth muscle to relax (D pair); acting on the radial muscles of the iris (pupil) The α₁ receptor of the dilator muscle causes the dilator muscle to contract and the pupil dilates (E error). The state of sympathetic nerve excitement can be used to assist memory with the body's physiological state during strenuous exercise: During strenuous exercise, the body's sympathetic nerves are excited (P336), the heart rate accelerates, myocardial contractility increases, and cardiac output increases, with the purpose of providing muscle strength throughout the body. Provide more blood and oxygen; respiratory movement is strengthened, bronchial smooth muscles relax, and alveolar ventilation is intended to provide more oxygen to the blood; vascular smooth muscles in the skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal and other parts of the body all contract, but skeletal muscle blood vessels The purpose of relaxation is to redistribute blood and provide more blood to the muscles; because the whole body blood is distributed to the skeletal muscles, the blood supply to the gastrointestinal tract is insufficient, which is not conducive to digestion and absorption of the gastrointestinal tract, so the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract relax and the sphincter contraction, digestive gland secretion decreases; during strenuous exercise, there is generally no particularly strong urge to urinate, and the inability to urinate, etc.",

        "Option B": "hydrochloric acid",
        "Option C": "Pepsin",
        "Option D": "pancreatic juice",
        "Option E": "bile",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Hydrochloric acid, pepsin, pancreatic juice and bile are subject to dual regulation by neural regulation and humoral regulation, while saliva is regulated by nerves. The nerve fibers that innervate the salivary glands include parasympathetic nerves and sympathetic nerves, of which the parasympathetic nerves play a major role in stimulating saliva secretion. It is necessary to talk about the difference and connection between the parasympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve: the vagus nerve is the 10th pair of nerves among the 12 pairs of cranial nerves. Compared with other cranial nerves, the vagus nerve has the longest journey and is widely distributed, from motor organs to sensory organs, from The nerve runs from the neck to the chest and reaches the abdominal cavity. It is called the vagus nerve because it is \"easy to get lost\" when traveling far away. The vagus nerve is a mixed nerve, containing four fiber components: special visceral motor fibers (efferent fibers), general visceral motor fibers (efferent fibers), general visceral sensory fibers (afferent fibers), and general somatosensory fibers (afferent fibers). . Among them, the general visceral motor fibers are the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic nerve, which are the main components of the vagus nerve. After being replaced by the ganglia, they innervate the heart, bronchi, esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, small intestine, part of the large intestine and other thoracic and abdominal organs. of smooth muscles and glands. Since the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic ganglia that innervate the thoracic and abdominal organs run in the vagus nerve, we often refer to the parasympathetic nerve that innervates the thoracic and abdominal organs as the vagus nerve. For example, textbooks say, “The heart is dually innervated by the sympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve.” More A strict statement should be that \"the heart is dually innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, with the parasympathetic part coming from the parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve.\" Does that mean the parasympathetic nerve is part of the vagus nerve? No, in addition to the part that runs in the 10th cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, the parasympathetic nerve also has parts in the oculomotor nerve (3rd cranial nerve), facial nerve (7th cranial nerve), and glossopharyngeal nerve (9th pair). cranial nerves) and pelvic nerves. Therefore, the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nerve are not equivalent. They have a mutually inclusive relationship. The parasympathetic nerve that controls the salivary glands is the 7th cranial nerve - facial nerve and the 9th cranial nerve - glossopharyngeal nerve, not the 10th cranial nerve. Cranial nerve - vagus nerve. Therefore, this question gives the stem vagus nerve and it is incorrect to regard the parasympathetic nerve that controls the salivary glands as the vagus nerve. In fact, the vagus nerve is an anatomical definition of nerve fibers, while the parasympathetic nerve is a functional definition. The functional counterpart to the parasympathetic nerve is the sympathetic nerve. The sympathetic nerve and parasympathetic nerve constitute the visceral nervous system ( P335).",

The activity of the sympathetic nervous system is related to the distribution of norepinephrine receptors on various organs. . When sympathetic nerves are excited, the α₂ receptors or β₂ receptors that act on the smooth muscle of the small intestine relax the smooth muscle of the small intestine and inhibit intestinal peristalsis (Pair A); the α₁ receptor that acts on the pupillary dilator muscle (iris radial muscle) dilates the pupil.

Acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate are oxidized and utilized in extrahepatic tissues. Since the utilization of β-hydroxybutyrate is first catalyzed by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, Dehydrogenation generates acetoacetate, which is then converted into acetyl CoA and oxidized. Therefore, the oxidation of ketone bodies mainly refers to the oxidation of acetoacetate. There are two pathways for the oxidation of acetoacetate: one is in the heart, kidney, brain and skeletal muscle mitochondria, catalyzed by succinyl-CoA transsulfurase to generate acetoacetyl CoA; the other is in the kidney, heart and brain mitochondria, catalyzed by acetoacetate thiokinase , directly activated to generate acetoacetyl CoA.

The level of adrenal medulla hormone secretion rises sharply, causing central nervous system System excitability is enhanced. At this time, the body is extremely responsive and in a state of alert; the heart rate accelerates, cardiac output increases, blood pressure rises, and blood volume throughout the body is redistributed to ensure increased blood flow to the heart, brain, muscles and other organs; breathing deepens Accelerate; blood sugar rises, fat is decomposed, and glucose and fat oxidation are enhanced to meet the body's rapidly increasing energy needs in emergency situations. In short, try your best to mobilize the potential of many organs in the body and improve your coping ability. This adaptive response of enhanced activity of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary (B pair) system that occurs in emergencies is called the emergency response (P396) (the emergency response is not a stress response, and the stress response (P393) is mobilized during system is the hypothalamic-adenopituitary-adrenocortical system).

The regulatory effect of the vagus-islet system is exactly opposite to that of the sympathetic-adrenal medulla system that is mobilized during emergency response (A is wrong). The hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system (P370) (C error) can secrete vasopressin and oxytocin. The former can increase blood pressure and promote renal reabsorption of water, and the latter can stimulate uterine contraction and promote milk discharge during lactation. None are related to emergency response. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (D error) plays an important role in maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance (P247) and regulating blood pressure (P134), but it has nothing to do with emergency response.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Thyroid hormone acts on almost all tissues of the body, and its biological effects are extremely extensive and complex. For details, please refer to (P376-P379) \"Biological Effects of Thyroid Hormone\". Let’s focus on option D. The complexity of thyroid hormone function is especially reflected in the regulation of material metabolism. Overall, thyroid hormone regulates the synthesis and catabolism of sugar, fat, and protein. When secreted in appropriate amounts, it promotes anabolism. The effect of thyroid hormone is more obvious; when it is secreted in excess, it promotes catabolism more obviously. For protein, excessive secretion of thyroid hormone promotes catabolism more than anabolism, thus causing a negative nitrogen balance. Physiological effects refer to the effects on normal physiological activities. Under normal physiological activities, thyroid hormone is in an appropriate amount, mainly promoting protein anabolism (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

The blood filling in the rapid filling phase and the slow filling phase originates from the suction effect of blood in the atria and great veins during ventricular diastole, and accounts for the vast majority of the total ventricular filling volume (D pair). Blood filling during atrial systole originates from atrial contraction, accounting for 10%-30% of the total ventricular filling, and cannot be considered the main cause of ventricular blood filling (C is wrong).

He may be diagnosed For nephritis. His hemoglobin is 9.8g/dl (normal adult male hemoglobin is 12g/dl~16g/dl), which indicates anemia (mostly indicating a chronic disease course), so the most likely diagnosis is an acute attack of chronic nephritis (pair B). Acute nephritis (False A) may manifest as acute nephritic syndrome, but anemia is generally not present. Acute exacerbations of chronic pyelonephritis (C error) mostly present symptoms of infection and poisoning such as fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as low back pain, percussion pain in the kidney area, and urinary tract irritation (P493).

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Ketone bodies include acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. The production of acetone is very small and can be exhaled through the lungs. Acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate are oxidized and utilized in extrahepatic tissues. Since the utilization of β-hydroxybutyrate is first catalyzed by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, Dehydrogenation generates acetoacetate, which is then converted into acetyl CoA and oxidized. Therefore, the oxidation of ketone bodies mainly refers to the oxidation of acetoacetate. There are two pathways for the oxidation of acetoacetate: one is in the heart, kidney, brain and skeletal muscle mitochondria, catalyzed by succinyl-CoA transsulfurase to generate acetoacetyl CoA; the other is in the kidney, heart and brain mitochondria, catalyzed by acetoacetate thiokinase , directly activated to generate acetoacetyl CoA. Liver tissue cannot utilize ketone bodies due to the lack of succinyl-CoA transsulfurase (D pair) and acetoacetate thiokinase, two enzymes that utilize ketone bodies. HMG-CoA synthase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of ketone bodies (P151) and cholesterol (P162). HMG-CoA lyase (B error) is an enzyme involved in ketone body synthesis.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Some metabolites in the body can combine non-covalently and reversibly with a part outside the active center of some enzymes, causing conformational changes of the enzyme (not configuration changes, cis-trans isomerism, optical isomerism, etc. are configurations, secondary Structure, tertiary structure, quaternary structure and other spatial structures are conformations) (E pair), thereby changing the activity of the enzyme. This regulation method of the enzyme is called allosteric regulation of the enzyme, also known as allosteric regulation. Enzymes that can be allosterically regulated are called allosteric enzymes (A pair), which are often composed of multiple subunits. Since there are positive or negative synergistic effects between multiple subunits, their reaction kinetics do not obey the Michaelis-Menten equation ( C is wrong and is the correct answer to this question).

The main types of such receptors include tyrosine kinase receptors, tyrosine kinase-binding receptors, guanylyl cyclase receptors and serine/threonine kinase receptors. Tyrosine kinase receptors, also known as receptor tyrosine kinases, are characterized by an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. The ligands that activate this type of receptor are mainly various growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin. Tyrosine kinase-binding receptors are different from tyrosine kinase receptors in that they have no enzymatic activity. Instead, they bind to the tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasm inside the cell after activation and activate it. Phosphorylates tyrosine residues of downstream signaling proteins to produce biological effects. The ligands that usually activate this type of receptor are various growth factors and peptide hormones, such as erythropoietin, interferon (B pair), interleukins, growth hormone, prolactin and leptin. Guanylyl cyclase receptor is a single-transmembrane α-helical molecule with a ligand-binding domain at the extracellular N-terminus and a G active domain at the intracellular C-terminus. The ligands that activate this receptor are mainly atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, the receptor for nitric oxide, which is a gas messenger molecule, is also a soluble guanylyl cyclase free in the cytoplasm. The intracellular domain of serine/threonine kinase receptors has serine/threonine kinase activity, such as transforming growth factor-β receptor, etc. After the receptor is activated, the serine/threonine residues of Smad protein It is activated by phosphorylation and translocated into the nucleus to regulate the expression of specific protein genes.",

        "Option C": "surface effect",
        "Option D": "proximity effect",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Pyruvate produced by glycolysis has two metabolic pathways: anaerobic oxidation and aerobic oxidation. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate accepts the hydrogen of NADH+H⁺ and is reduced to lactic acid. When the oxygen supply is sufficient, NADH+H⁺ enters the mitochondria. Oxidation, pyruvate is completely decomposed into CO₂ and H₂O. At this time, because pyruvate and NADH+H⁺ are used, anaerobic oxidation in the body is inhibited. This phenomenon of aerobic oxidation inhibiting anaerobic oxidation (glycolysis) is called Pasteur effect (B pair). It should be explained that in the seventh edition and earlier editions of textbooks, glycolysis is conceptually equivalent to anaerobic oxidation, that is, glycolysis refers to the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and then reducing it to lactic acid, which is converted from glucose to The process of pyruvate is called the glycolysis pathway, and glycolysis includes two stages: the glycolysis pathway and lactate production. Starting from the eighth edition of the textbook, the concept of glycolysis has changed. It only refers to the process of converting glucose into pyruvate (the original glycolysis pathway). The redefined \"glycolysis\" becomes the anaerobic oxidation of glucose and the aerobic oxidation of glucose. Common initiating pathway for oxidation. Therefore, according to the concept of the new version of the textbook, the question should be changed to \"The effect of aerobic oxidation of sugar on inhibiting anaerobic oxidation is called\". The allosteric effect, also known as the allosteric effect, is a phenomenon in which metabolites in the body combine with proteins to change the conformation of the protein, leading to changes in the biological activity of the protein (A is wrong). Surface effects (P61) are found in enzymatic reactions. Surface effects can desolvate substrate molecules, eliminate the interfering attraction and repulsion of a large number of surrounding water molecules to functional groups in enzymes and substrate molecules, and prevent the formation of hydrated films. , which is conducive to the close contact and combination of substrate and enzyme molecules (C error). Proximity effect (P61) is also seen in enzymatic reactions. The enzyme binds many substrates to the active center during the reaction, bringing them close to each other and forming a correct orientation relationship that is conducive to the reaction, thus increasing the reaction rate. It is called proximity effect (D error). ).",

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The semicircular canal is a vestibular organ. Its receptors are hair cells located in the ampullae ridge. The cilia of the hair cells are free in the endolymph. Its appropriate stimulation is the mechanical force parallel to the plane where the cilia originate. The semicircular canal is subject to excessive force. Or long-term stimulation can cause autonomic nervous system dysfunction through the connection between the vestibular nucleus and the reticular structure, leading to accelerated heart rate, decreased blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, sweating, pale skin, nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, etc. , called vestibular autonomic response. When cold water enters one ear, the temperature of the external auditory canal decreases. The change in temperature affects the external semicircular canal through the tympanic membrane, tympanum and bone wall. The endolymph fluid changes its specific gravity due to thermal expansion and contraction, causing endolymph fluid convection of \"heat rises and cold falls\" phenomenon, causing the hair cell cilia of the ampullae ridge to bend (this process does not involve changes in the spatial position of the head, and there is no change in the movement of the ampullae ridge) (wrong B), the semicircular canals are stimulated, and vegetative functions such as dizziness and nausea occur. Altered symptoms (autonomic responses) (pair E). The otolith organ refers to the utricle and saccule, which are suitable for stimulation by ultra-speed movement rather than low temperature. Low temperature cannot effectively stimulate the otolith organ and cause its excitement, which in turn causes changes in autonomic nervous function (A is wrong). Cold water entering the lateral ear causes endolymph fluid to flow, the semicircular canals are stimulated, and vestibular afferent nerve discharge increases (D is wrong), leading to autonomic nervous reactions such as dizziness and nausea. Therefore, option C \"increased vestibular afferent nerve discharge\" itself is correct. However, the increase in vestibular afferent nerve discharge is not directly caused by cold water entering the lateral ear (C is wrong).",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Shock is a pathophysiological process in which the body's effective circulating blood volume is reduced, tissue perfusion is insufficient, cell metabolism is disordered, and functions are damaged. During the occurrence and development of shock, the body's microcirculation goes through a contraction phase → an expansion phase → a failure phase, that is, the condition continues to develop. After entering irreversible shock, extensive circulatory failure occurs, causing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, in patients who die from shock, the most common type of thrombus in tissue sections is hyaline thrombus (fibrinous thrombus) (pair B). White thrombus (C error) is often located in the heart valves, cardiac chambers and arteries with rapid blood flow, such as the thrombus formed on the edge of mitral valve atresia in acute rheumatic endocarditis; in venous thrombosis, the white thrombus is located in The origin of a persistent thrombus (the head of the thrombus). Mixed thrombus (A error) is more common in the body of continuous intravenous thrombus, and is also found in the heart chamber, atherosclerotic ulcer site or aneurysm (because the bottom of the thrombus is connected to the heart wall or blood vessel wall, it is called mural thrombus ). Red thrombus (D error) is mainly found in veins.

The liver has dual blood supply from the portal vein and hepatic artery, and is connected to the intestinal lumen through the biliary system. Therefore, bacteria can invade the liver in various ways and cause liver abscess. The common routes are mainly through the biliary tract, hepatic artery, and portal vein, but the most common route of infection is biliary infection, accounting for about 41.4%, and blood-borne infection accounts for about 23.9% (B error). In some cases, bacteria can enter the liver along the portal vein (False C), but not in most cases. There are no nerve endings distributed in the liver parenchyma and no pain is produced. The swelling and pain presented are caused by the compression of the capsule by the enlarged liver, which often manifests as persistent dull pain without severe colic in the liver area (D is wrong).

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "GTP-binding protein is G protein, which is composed of three subunits: α, β, and γ. Among them, α subunit has GTPase activity and is the main functional subunit of G protein. According to the different functions of α subunit, G protein can be divided into They are Gs (excitatory G protein), Gi (inhibitory G protein), Gq and other types (Ninth Edition of Physiology P27). Therefore, the question statement is slightly ambiguous. GS is not a subunit type, but a G protein type. Cholera toxin (A pair) can bind to the subunit of G protein and cause it to lose its GTPase activity: cholera toxin can bind to the α subunit of Gs protein, causing it to undergo ADP-ribosylation modification and inhibit its GTPase activity. , resulting in Gs protein being continuously activated and causing disease. The pathogenic mechanism of pertussis toxin (B error) is very similar to that of cholera toxin. It can bind to the α subunit of Gi protein (different from the Gs protein inhibited by cholera toxin), causing it to undergo ADP-ribosylation modification and inhibit its GTPase. activity, causing the Gi protein to be continuously activated and cause disease. Diphtheria toxin (P303) (C error) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It can inactivate ADP glycosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor eEF-2 and prevent peptide chain elongation. Antimycin A (P133) (D error) is an inhibitor of complex III in the respiratory chain.

        "Explanation": "The basic lesions of silicosis are the formation of silica nodules and diffuse fibrosis of lung tissue (pulmonary interstitium) (pair B). Silicon nodules are round or oval nodules with clear boundaries. In the early stages of silicon nodule formation, they are cellular nodules formed by the accumulation of giant cells that devour silica dust. As the disease progresses, the nodules undergo fibrosis and form fibers. Sexual nodule, the collagen fibers in the nodule are arranged in a concentric ring (E pair). Adjacent silica nodules can fuse to form large nodular lesions, the center of which often undergoes necrosis due to ischemia and hypoxia (pair D), forming a silicotic cavity. In the early stage of silicosis, silicon nodules are mainly limited to the hilar lymph nodes, and the number of silicon nodules in the lung tissue is small (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). Due to the reduced defense ability of diseased tissues against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, patients with silicosis are prone to develop tuberculosis, which is called silicosis tuberculosis (pair A).",

Only those that penetrate blood vessels and form metastasis in metastatic organs or tissues can form metastatic cancer (False A). In non-traumatic diseases such as diabetes, alcoholism and chronic pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia or strong mental stimulation, excessive stress makes the blood lipids in the suspended milk state unable to remain stable and free and fuse with each other to form fat droplets, which can also cause fat embolism ( B is wrong). Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare and serious complication during childbirth, with a mortality rate of more than 80% (C wrong). The human body quickly enters a normal pressure or low pressure environment from a high pressure environment, and the originally dissolved gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen quickly dissociate to form bubbles. Oxygen and carbon dioxide can be redissolved in body fluids and absorbed, but nitrogen dissolves slowly in body fluids, forming many microbubbles or merging into large bubbles, causing gas embolism, that is, decompression sickness. Therefore, decompression sickness is nitrogen embolism (E is wrong). More than 95% of the emboli that cause pulmonary artery thromboembolism come from the deep veins of the lower limbs. The emboli from the deep veins of the lower limbs reach the right atrium through the systemic circulation, and then reach the pulmonary artery with smaller blood vessels through the pulmonary circulation, causing pulmonary embolism (D pair).",

        "Explanation": "Fibrinitis is an inflammation dominated by the exudation of fibrinogen, followed by the formation of fibrin, that is, cellulose. It is mostly caused by certain bacterial toxins or poisons and easily occurs in mucosa, serosa and lung tissue. Common fibrinitis include: diphtheria, lobar pneumonia (B pair), villous heart (C pair), bacillary dysentery (D pair), etc. A small amount of cellulose can be absorbed. If too much cellulose leaks out, it can cause malabsorption of cellulose and cause organogenesis (pair A). Viral hepatitis causes disease through immune response and is an inflammation dominated by deterioration without cellulose exudation (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard, including sputum cytology, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration cytology or histology (TTNA), pleural effusion examination, etc. Clinically, the method needs to be selected based on the specific situation. For central lung cancer, fiberoptic bronchoscopy + biopsy is the first choice for diagnosis. For peripheral lung cancer, transchest wall biopsy is the first choice for diagnosis. For pleural effusion suspected to be caused by lung cancer metastasis, the pleural effusion can be aspirated for cytological examination to look for cancer cells. For central lung cancer, especially cases with bloody sputum, the chance of finding cancer cells in the sputum is higher. The answer to this question is option C. It may be because bronchoscopy can directly observe lung cancer and take tissue biopsy, but it is mostly used for the diagnosis of central lung cancer and has little significance for peripheral lung cancer. X-ray examination (A error) is a commonly used screening method for lung cancer. Sputum cytology (B error) is mainly used for the auxiliary diagnosis of central lung cancer accompanied by bloody sputum.

        "Option A": "Different parts of auscultation",
        "Option B": "Relationship with respiratory movements",
        "Option C": "relationship with posture",
        "Option D": "The nature of fricative sounds is different",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Pleural friction rub is a sound that occurs with breathing when the pleura becomes rough due to inflammation. It can appear, disappear or reappear in a very short period of time, or can last for several days or longer. It occurs even during exhalation and inhalation. It can be heard, usually more obvious at the end of inhalation and the beginning of exhalation, and disappears when you hold your breath. Pericardial friction rub is a sound that occurs when the heart layer and wall layer are roughened due to fibrin deposition caused by biological or physical and chemical factors, causing friction when the heart beats. Therefore, it is consistent with the heartbeat, and the friction sound still exists when holding the breath. Therefore, the most important point of differentiation between pleural rub and pericardial rub is the relationship with respiratory movement (pair B). The most commonly heard site of pleural friction rub is the anteroinferior chest wall. The loudest pericardial friction rub is in the precordial area or the third and fourth intercostal spaces on the left sternal edge. It cannot be identified based on the auscultation site (wrong A). Pleural friction rub can disappear or reappear with changes in body position, and is obvious in sitting or lying position. Pericardial friction rub is obvious in sitting and leaning forward, so the two cannot be distinguished based on their relationship with body position (C wrong). The nature of the sounds of pleural friction rub varies greatly. Some sounds are soft and subtle, such as the friction of silk fabrics, while others are rough, such as scratching, rustling, stepping on or holding snow. The sound of pericardial friction rub is similar to the friction of paper, so It is impossible to identify the two fricative sounds based on their different properties (D is wrong). Pericardial friction rub is seen in various infectious pericarditis, and can also be seen in pericarditis caused by non-infectious conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, uremia, post-cardiac injury syndrome, and SLE. Pleural friction rub is common in patients with fibrinous pleurisy, pulmonary infarction, pleural tumors and uremia.",

        "Option C": "aortic valve insufficiency",
        "Option D": "Pulmonary valve insufficiency",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The possible cause of diastolic rumble-like murmur at the apex of the heart is aortic regurgitation (pair C). When aortic regurgitation is severe, the regurgitant jet impacts the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and pushes the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve forward. It starts at a higher position, affecting its opening, causing relative mitral stenosis, and a diastolic rumble-like murmur at the apex (P299). This murmur is a functional mitral valve murmur (non-organic mitral stenosis murmur), which is mainly seen in moderate to severe aortic valve regurgitation. The most prominent sign of patent ductus arteriosus (A) is a loud, continuous machine sound-like murmur in the second intercostal space on the left sternal border, which occupies almost the entire systole and diastole. It is loudest at the end of systole and is accompanied by tremor, and the shunt is relatively large. In older patients, diastolic murmur (relative mitral stenosis) in the apex area can be heard (9th edition of Surgery P285, Practical Surgery P1444), but compared with aortic insufficiency, the latter is more likely to hear diastolic rumbling in the apex. Such noise. The murmur produced by ventricular septal defect (B) is a rough and loud holosystolic murmur in the 2nd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal border (Ninth Edition of Surgery P289). When the shunt flow is large, relative mitral stenosis may also occur. , a diastolic rumble-like murmur can be heard at the apex of the heart. Simple pulmonary valve insufficiency (D error) is rare. It is mostly a functional murmur caused by relative insufficiency caused by dilation of the main pulmonary artery. It is an early diastolic descending breath-like murmur in the pulmonary valve area. When accompanied by pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary valve auscultation area When the second heart sound is hyperactive and split, and the regurgitant volume is large, a low-key presystolic murmur can be heard in the tricuspid valve area (Practical Internal Medicine P1531).

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The subxiphoid pulse may be the systolic pulse of the right ventricle, or it may be generated by the abdominal aortic pulse. After inhalation, the negative pressure in the chest promotes the perfusion of blood from the right ventricle to the lungs, making the pulse stronger. In this question, the patient can see a pulse under the xiphoid process, which is obvious after taking a deep breath. It can be judged that the pulse comes from the right ventricle (C is true, A is wrong). Small lesions of hepatic hemangioma (B error) are often asymptomatic. Larger lesions can cause upper abdominal discomfort or palpable masses. Giant hemangiomas can significantly enlarge the liver, accompanied by abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, and loss of appetite. Symptoms such as indigestion do not cause subxiphoid pulses. Ventricular aneurysm (D error) is a condition in patients with coronary heart disease who develops ventricular wall dilation, thinning, and full-thickness myocardial necrosis in the infarcted area after a large-scale myocardial infarction. The necrotic myocardium is gradually replaced by fibrous scar tissue, and the thin-layered ventricular wall in the lesion area moves toward Exterior bulge, loss of mobility or abnormal movement during cardiac contraction, forming a ventricular aneurysm, which is common in the left ventricle and does not cause subxiphoid pulses.",

Cardiac asthma is dyspnea (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) caused by left heart failure and is more common in patients with organic heart disease (to avoid confusion, the term \"cardiac asthma\" is no longer used). Both bronchial asthma and cardiogenic asthma can have clinical manifestations such as cough (False A), frequent attacks at night (False B), and wheezing in both lungs (False D). However, patients with bronchial asthma cough mucus sputum, and those with cardiogenic asthma The patient often coughs up pink frothy sputum. Typical symptoms of a bronchial asthma attack are expiratory dyspnea accompanied by wheezing, which can be relieved after treatment with antiasthmatic drugs or by itself. Cardiogenic asthma (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) occurs when the patient suddenly suffers from holding his breath after falling asleep. When awakened and forced to sit, severe cases may cause wheezing, which is usually relieved after sitting upright and resting.

Physical examination showed P96 beats/min (normal heart rate range: 60 to 100 beats/min), BP 125/75mmHg (90mmHg≤normal systolic blood pressure <139mmHg, 60mmHg ≤normal diastolic blood pressure <89mmHg), clear breath sounds in both lungs, regular heart rhythm (the above indicates stable hemodynamics), swelling of the right lower limb (DVT symptoms), ultrasound indicates right ventricular dysfunction (the presence of right ventricular dysfunction), cTnT0. 2ng/ml (>cTnT0.1ng/ml, diagnostic criteria for intermediate-risk PTE myocardial injury), CT pulmonary angiography showed \"multiple pulmonary artery filling defects in the right lower and left upper lungs\" (PTE imaging manifestations), according to the patient's clinical manifestations, signs, Based on laboratory test results and imaging results, the patient was diagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). The thrombus came from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the clinical classification was intermediate risk (P102). Anticoagulant therapy is the basic treatment method for PTE and DVT. It can significantly improve the patient's survival rate and reduce the recurrence rate of thromboembolism. This patient is a moderate-risk patient with normal blood pressure and right ventricular dysfunction. Regardless of whether thrombolysis is used or not, the first choice is For anticoagulation treatment, low molecular weight heparin is more convenient to use than unfractionated heparin, and its efficacy is not inferior to unfractionated heparin, so it is the first choice in this case (pair B). The application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (A error) belongs to thrombolytic therapy and is mainly suitable for high-risk (large-area) PTE cases (with obvious dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxemia, etc.). For some intermediate-risk patients, It can be considered if there are no contraindications, but it is not the first choice treatment. Clopidogrel (C error) and aspirin (D error) are antiplatelet drugs. Their anticoagulant effects cannot meet the anticoagulation requirements of PTE or DVT. They are not used for the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism and are mostly used in the drug treatment of atherosclerosis. .",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The main purpose of thrombolytic treatment for pulmonary embolism is to relieve circulatory disorders. Indications for pulmonary embolism patients who should consider thrombolytic treatment are hypotension or symptoms of circulatory disorders such as syncope and shock (pair A). When circulatory disorders occur, there is no other treatment except thrombolysis. Other treatments can relieve patient symptoms. Thrombolytic therapy can quickly dissolve part or all of the thrombus, restore lung tissue reperfusion, reduce pulmonary artery resistance, lower pulmonary artery pressure, improve right ventricular function, and reduce the mortality and recurrence rate in patients with severe pulmonary embolism. . Hemoptysis (wrong D) is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy (a relative contraindication in the case of fatal massive pulmonary embolism). When severe chest pain and hypoxemia are not accompanied by blood pressure and right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolysis is not suitable. Severe chest pain alone (B error) and hypoxemia (C error) cannot be used as indications for thrombolytic treatment. For hypoxia, Hyemia can be resolved with mechanical ventilation.",

Probably nothing unusual. It should be noted that troponin is unique to the myocardium and is the most specific and sensitive first-choice marker for diagnosing myocardial necrosis. It needs to be selected based on the time of onset. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is distributed in many organs throughout the body. It has poor specificity in diagnosing myocardial infarction and is no longer recommended for clinical use.",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The X-ray examination of acute myocarditis shows an enlarged heart shadow, and there may be a \"flask heart\" in pericardial effusion. The X-ray examination of dilated cardiomyopathy also shows similar symptoms such as an enlarged heart shadow (A). Myocardial injury markers in acute myocarditis may include myocardial creatine kinase (CK-MB) and troponin (increased cTnT or cTnI). Patients with cardiomyopathy may also have mildly elevated cTnI, so it cannot be used as a differential test (B). The increase in blood BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in heart failure is positively correlated with the severity of the disease. It is an indicator for evaluating the process and prognosis of heart failure. The increase in blood BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in cardioectasis helps to identify the cause of dyspnea. Acute myocarditis causes heart failure. It will also increase with time, so it cannot be used as an identification test (C wrong). Dilated cardiomyopathy is mainly clinically diagnosed based on echocardiography and has clear characteristic changes. For patients with chronic heart failure, if echocardiography shows enlarged cardiac chambers and reduced cardiac systolic function, they should be considered to be dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy, while the echocardiographic findings of acute myocarditis may be normal, or may include left ventricular enlargement, reduced ventricular wall motion, reduced left ventricular systolic function, mural thrombosis, etc., but they are not specific and cannot be used as a diagnosis. standard.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The main pathophysiological change of dilated cardiomyopathy is the disorder of cardiac pumping function. In the early stage, the heart rate can be accelerated to maintain sufficient cardiac output. In the later stage, as left ventricular emptying is restricted, ventricular diastolic and end-systolic volumes increase, and the ejection volume increases. The blood fraction decreases and the heart gradually enlarges, resulting in relative mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, leading to congestive heart failure. At this time, the end-diastolic pressure of the ventricle increases, especially in the left ventricle. B-ultrasound can show the end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle. Expansion of inner diameter (pair D), general suppression of ventricular wall motion (wrong C, the correct answer to this question), mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation (pair B), general weakening of myocardial systolic function, ejection fraction Significantly reduced, the left ventricular ejection fraction is basically reduced to less than 50% (15th edition of Practical Internal Medicine P1096) (Pair A), and there may be a small amount of pericardial effusion.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "60-year-old male patient (a group with a high risk of STEMI), suffered from squeezing pain in the left chest accompanied by profuse sweating for 3 hours, and the self-contained Suxiao Jiuxin Pills were ineffective (typical clinical manifestations of STEMI chest pain). Physical examination: P85 times/min, BP80/50mmHg, skin of extremities Feeling cold, no rales heard in both lungs, arrhythmia, low S₁ (clinical manifestation of cardiogenic shock), ECG: sinus rhythm, occasional premature atrial contractions, ST segment in leads I, aVL, V₂~V₆ Elevation and T wave inversion (electrocardiographic manifestations of acute extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction). Based on the patient's clinical manifestations, signs and imaging examination results, the most likely diagnosis is acute extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction (electrocardiogram suggests left anterior descending artery disease, consider acute left heart infarction). At this time, the patient is already in cardiogenic shock. Treatment of the cause is the key to treating cardiogenic shock. The primary treatment for acute myocardial infarction is reperfusion therapy. Aortic balloon counterpulsation is often used in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Adjuvant treatment methods are advocated for timely use in the early stages of shock. Therefore, the appropriate first aid measure for this patient is to place an aortic balloon counterpulsation device (D pair). The aortic balloon counterpulsation device (IABP) is used to increase diastolic arterial pressure. It does not increase left ventricular systolic load and helps increase coronary perfusion, providing an important transition and opportunity for patients with STEMI combined with cardiogenic shock to undergo coronary angiography and mechanical reperfusion (PCI or CABG). Class I recommendation: prophylactic use of IABP should be considered in patients with extensive STEMI or high-risk patients. The patient is in cardiogenic shock (left myocardial infarction), and rehydration therapy will increase left ventricular preload, work and oxygen consumption (A is wrong). Lidocaine (B error) is mainly used for ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation caused by cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization, myocardial infarction, or cardiac glycoside poisoning. Nitroglycerin (C) is not suitable for this patient because of its vasodilatory effect, which can lower blood pressure and cause low perfusion pressure in important organs such as the heart and brain.",

He suffered from palpitations, chest tightness, and shortness of breath after activity for half a year (decompensation of cardiac function may lead to symptoms of target organ damage). He has been suffering from high blood pressure for 15 years without systemic treatment ( History of hypertension), physical examination P82 beats/min (normal heart rate range 60-100 beats/min), BP150/70mmHg (90mmHg≤normal systolic blood pressure<139mmHg, 60mmHg≤normal diastolic blood pressure<89mmHg, simple systolic hypertension) , lungs (-), the heart boundary expands to the lower left, and a grade 3/6 systolic wind-like murmur can be heard. Echocardiography shows that the left atrium is enlarged, the left ventricular wall is thickened, the mitral valve is slightly thickened, and the ventricular wall motion is normal ( Hypertensive heart disease, cardiopulmonary manifestations). Based on the patient's personal history, clinical manifestations and signs, and imaging findings, the patient was first considered to have hypertensive heart disease (pair C). The patient may have no obvious clinical symptoms in the early stage, and may develop several years after the onset of hypertension. After more than ten years, clinical symptoms of cardiac insufficiency will appear. During the period of cardiac function compensation, except for occasional palpitations, other cardiac symptoms may not be obvious. When the compensatory function is imbalanced, symptoms of left heart failure may appear, such as paroxysmal nocturnal episodes. Difficulty breathing, wheezing, palpitations, coughing after exertion, etc. After the heart enlarges, physical examination shows that the heart boundary expands to the left and downwards, the apex beats like a lift, and a grade II to III systolic wind-like murmur can be heard in the apex area. This is A fourth heart sound may occur due to relative mitral regurgitation or mitral valve papilla dysfunction caused by left ventricular enlargement. Dilated cardiomyopathy (A error) is a type of cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular or biventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction. The clinical manifestations are cardiac enlargement, heart failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolism and sudden death. The disease may manifest in the end stage. It is persistent refractory hypotension. The main signs are enlargement of the heart boundary, weakened heart sounds on auscultation, and the third or fourth heart sound can often be heard. Echocardiography shows generally weakened ventricular wall activity, decreased myocardial systolic function, and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. (P261). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) often manifests as group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection 1 to 6 weeks before the onset of typical symptoms, such as pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Rheumatic valvular heart disease (B error) mainly involves the mitral valve. Sometimes a high-pitched, systolic wind-like murmur can be heard in the apical area followed by a short, low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur, which may be accompanied by fever, rash, subcutaneous nodules, chorea, etc. (P805). Coronary heart disease (D error) is caused by coronary atherosclerosis. It can have different clinical characteristics according to the location of coronary artery lesions, blood supply range, degree of vascular obstruction, and the development speed of insufficient blood supply to the myocardium, and is divided into chronic Stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome are two major categories.",

        "Explanation": "62-year-old male with cardiac insufficiency after myocardial infarction suddenly suffered type A pre-excitation syndrome and atrial fibrillation. The electrical conduction pathway is forward conduction through the atrioventricular node and retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway. Therefore, drugs that prolong the refractory period of the accessory pathway should be selected. In this patient with atrial fibrillation combined with organic heart disease and heart failure, amiodarone is the first choice (pair D). However, with atrial fibrillation combined with pre-excitation syndrome, a more reasonable first-choice treatment is radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular accessory pathway. Propafenone (C error) belongs to Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs. It is used for various supraventricular tachycardia by slowing down Vmax, slowing down conduction and slightly prolonging the action potential duration, but it has a strong inhibitory effect on the heart. It aggravates heart failure, so it should be used with caution in patients with organic heart disease and is not the first choice. Trinoside c (A) is a digitalis preparation that slows down atrioventricular node conduction, shortens the refractory period of the accessory pathway, accelerates the ventricular rate, and easily induces ventricular fibrillation. It should not be used alone in patients who have experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter. Metoprolol (B error) is a β-receptor antagonist that has negative effects on the heart.

In chronic left heart failure, left ventricular ejection dysfunction results in increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Blood in the left atrium during diastole cannot flow smoothly into the left ventricle, causing an increase in left atrial pressure and left atrial pressure. The increase blocks the pulmonary vein blood return, causing pulmonary circulation congestion, which is not active congestion of the pulmonary circulation (B is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). Because various diseases cause the weakening of myocardial contractility, which reduces cardiac output and makes it difficult to meet the needs of the body, and at the same time manifests congestion in the pulmonary circulation and/or systemic circulation, heart failure is also called congestive heart failure (pair E).

Hypoxemia and hypercapnia (D pair) can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and spasm. Hypoxia is the most important factor in the formation of pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia can increase vasoconstrictor active substances and permeate smooth muscle cell membranes. H⁺ is increased, intracellular Ca²⁺ is increased, pulmonary vascular smooth muscle contraction is enhanced, and pulmonary vascular resistance is increased; excessive H⁺ production during hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis increases the sensitivity of blood vessels to hypoxia, causing pulmonary hypertension. (2) Anatomical factors that increase pulmonary vascular resistance: ① Long-term recurring COPD and peribronchitis involve pulmonary arterioles, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance; ② Emphysema causes an increase in intra-alveolar pressure, compressing the capillaries around the alveoli. The vascular bed increases pulmonary circulation resistance; ③ chronic hypoxia leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling; ④ multiple in situ pulmonary microartery thrombosis occurs in some patients during the acute attack of chronic pulmonary heart disease. (3) Increased blood viscosity (pair E) and increased blood volume can also aggravate pulmonary hypertension. Airway obstruction (B is wrong, is the correct answer to this question) is not the main factor in the onset of chronic pulmonary heart disease.",

        "Question": "Which statement is incorrect regarding the role of ATP in energy metabolism?",
        "Option A": "The energy required for synthetic reactions in the body is directly supplied by ATP",
        "Option B": "The generation, storage, release and utilization of energy are all centered on ATP",
        "Option C": "The chemical energy of ATP can be converted into mechanical energy, osmotic energy, electrical energy and thermal energy, etc.",
        "Option D": "ATP is generated through oxidative phosphorylation",
        "Option E": "The content of ATP in the body is very small and the conversion is very fast.",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "ATP is mainly generated through oxidative phosphorylation (D pair). It is a form of energy that can be directly utilized by cells. However, not all the energy required for synthetic reactions in the body is directly supplied by ATP. For example, UTP, CTP, and GTP can be glycogen respectively. , phospholipids, proteins, etc. are synthesized to provide energy (A is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). ATP is also the most important high-energy phosphate compound in the body. The generation, storage, release and utilization of energy in the body are all centered on ATP (pair B). The chemical energy of ATP can be converted into mechanical energy, osmotic energy, electrical energy and thermal energy (pair C). . The amount of ATP in the body is very small, and it can be used up in a very short time after the oxidative respiratory chain is interrupted. However, because the conversion between ATP and ADP is extremely fast under normal conditions (E pair), normal life activities can be guaranteed.",

        "Option C": "gastrointestinal sphincter relaxation",
        "Option D": "detrusor contraction",
        "Option E": "bronchial smooth muscle contraction",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The transmitter released by most sympathetic postganglionic fibers is norepinephrine (except for the sympathetic postganglionic fibers that innervate sweat glands and skeletal muscle blood vessels that release acetylcholine). The activity of the sympathetic nervous system is related to the distribution of norepinephrine receptors on various organs. . When the sympathetic nerve is excited, the α₁ receptors acting on the iris radial muscle (pupil dilator muscle) cause the iris radial muscle to contract and the pupil to dilate (A is wrong). The β₂ receptors (norepinephrine-mediated) or M receptors (acetylcholine-mediated) that act on skeletal muscle blood vessels dilate skeletal muscle blood vessels (B pair); the α₁ receptors that act on the gastrointestinal sphincter contracts the gastrointestinal sphincter. (C is wrong). The β₂ receptors acting on the detrusor muscle of the bladder cause the detrusor muscle to relax (D is wrong). β₂ receptors acting on bronchial smooth muscle cause bronchial smooth muscle to relax (E wrong). The state of sympathetic nerve excitement can be used to assist memory with the body's physiological state during strenuous exercise: During strenuous exercise, the body's sympathetic nerves are excited (P336), the heart rate accelerates, myocardial contractility increases, and cardiac output increases, with the purpose of providing muscle strength throughout the body. Provide more blood and oxygen; respiratory movement is strengthened, bronchial smooth muscles relax, and alveolar ventilation is intended to provide more oxygen to the blood; vascular smooth muscles in the skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal and other parts of the body all contract, but skeletal muscle blood vessels The purpose of relaxation is to redistribute blood and provide more blood to the muscles; because the whole body blood is distributed to the skeletal muscles, the blood supply to the gastrointestinal tract is insufficient, which is not conducive to digestion and absorption of the gastrointestinal tract, so the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract relax and the sphincter contraction, digestive gland secretion decreases; during strenuous exercise, there is generally no particularly strong urge to urinate, and the inability to urinate, etc.",

        "Option D": "aortic valve insufficiency",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "middle-aged female patient suffered from precordial pain after activity for 2 months. Self-contained nitroglycerin was ineffective (angina pectoris was temporarily ruled out). She had a history of hypertension and arthritis (possible causes of aortic regurgitation). She came to the hospital for a physical examination: P80/ points (normal value: 60~100 times/minute), BP150/65mmHg (normal value: 90mmHg﹤systolic blood pressure﹤140mmHg, 60mmHg﹤diastolic blood pressure﹤90mmHg; pulse systolic blood pressure increases, diastolic blood pressure decreases, and pulse pressure increases), BMI : 35 (BMI standard value: 18.5 ~ 23.9, obesity, heavy cardiac load), no enlargement of the thyroid gland, both lungs (-), regular heart rhythm, heart boundary expanding to the left (sign of aortic regurgitation), auscultation S₁ weakened (The weakened first heart sound is caused by overfilling of the left ventricle during diastole and the high position of the mitral valve). A rumble-like murmur in early and mid-diastole can be heard in the apex area, and a sigh-like murmur in diastole in the third intercostal space on the left sternal border (aorta) Characteristic murmur of valve insufficiency), edema of both lower limbs (+-). Based on the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and physical examination results, the most likely diagnosis is aortic valve insufficiency. The patient's precordial pain is mainly caused by the left ventricle. It is caused by excessive stretching of the ascending aorta or significant enlargement of the heart during ejection (pair D). Coronary heart disease (A) is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, which can be divided into chronic myocardial ischemia syndrome and acute coronary syndrome. Paroxysmal chest squeezing pain may occur, rest or use nitrate preparations. The pain disappears (P218); common symptoms of high blood pressure include dizziness, headache, tight neck, fatigue, palpitations, etc. Severe symptoms such as blurred vision and nosebleeds may also occur. Typical high blood pressure headaches can be resolved after the blood pressure drops. Disappear, hypertension, general auscultation can hear an elevated second heart sound, systolic murmur or early systolic click sound (P250). Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (B error) is a type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, when the left ventricle contracts, the rapid blood flow passes through the narrow outflow tract to generate negative pressure, causing the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve to become anterior. Movement in the direction aggravates the obstruction; a rough ejection systolic murmur (P266) can be heard in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal edge. The main cause of mitral stenosis (MS) (C error) is rheumatic fever, which is more common after acute rheumatic fever. Symptoms of mitral stenosis include difficulty breathing, coughing, and hemoptysis. Many audible and hyperactive symptoms can be seen in the apical area. The first heart sound can have a \"mitral valve face\". When the right ventricle is enlarged, a systolic lifting-like pulse can be palpated under the xiphoid process. The characteristic murmur of mitral valve stenosis is a low-key rumble-like murmur in the middle and late diastole in the apical area. Increasing type, localized, obvious when lying on the left side, and can be enhanced by exercise or forced exhalation (P287).",

Laboratory blood test showed Hb88g/L (normal adult female hemoglobin 110~150g/L, moderate anemia), WBC13.2×10⁹/L (normal adult 4~10×10⁹/L, slightly elevated), urine protein (+ ) (proteinuria), sediment microscopy shows 5 to 8 RBCs/HP (>3/HP, microscopic hematuria). Based on the patient’s medical history, clinical manifestations and signs, and laboratory tests, the most likely diagnosis is subacute infectious disease. Endocarditis (C pair), infective endocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart valves or ventricular wall lining caused by direct infection by bacteria, fungi and other pathogenic microorganisms. It should be noted that the 2009 European Society of Cardiology ( ESC) published a new version of the guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of IE (infectious endocarditis), abandoning the classification method of acute, subacute and chronic endocarditis. Acute glomerulonephritis (A) is a group of diseases with acute nephritic syndrome as the main clinical manifestation. The clinical manifestations are hematuria, proteinuria, edema and hypertension, which may be accompanied by transient renal insufficiency (P466). Rheumatic fever (B error) is a delayed-onset, non-suppurative sequelae caused by Group A streptococcus infection of the pharynx. The clinical manifestations are arthritis, carditis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules and marginal erythema. Typical symptoms appear. There will be prodromal symptoms (symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections such as pharyngitis or tonsillitis) in the first 1 to 6 weeks. Generally, there will be no peripheral signs such as petechiae and ecchymosis, and the kidneys are rarely involved (P805). Systemic lupus erythematosus (False D) is an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes are formed and mediate damage to organs and tissues. It manifests as multi-system involvement. WBC is often not elevated, and warts may appear. The pathological manifestations of endocarditis are different from those of infective endocarditis and usually do not cause changes in heart murmur (P816).",

        "Option E": "Decreased secretion of vasopressin due to decreased cardiac output",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "In heart failure, due to insufficient cardiac output, the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are activated, resulting in increased secretion of norepinephrine, vasopressin, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, bradykinin, etc. ( A is right). It is atrial natriuretic peptide synthesized and secreted by the atrium that has a strong diuretic effect, not bradykinin (bradykinin). Bradykinin is a vasoactive peptide that is acted on in the plasma by kininogenase. Produced by kininogen. Bradykinin can dilate arterioles, increase vascular permeability, contract bronchial smooth muscle, and cause pain (Pathology, 8th Edition, P74). In heart failure, the secretion of BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) increases significantly (C false). The degree of increase is positively correlated with the severity of heart failure and can be used as an indicator to evaluate the progression of heart failure and judge prognosis. Under the stimulation of bradykinin, vascular endothelial cells synthesize endothelium-dependent releasing factor (i.e. NO), which has a strong vasodilator effect rather than a vasoconstrictor effect (D is wrong). In heart failure, the sensitivity of the atrial stretch receptors decreases, and the signal transmitted to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve decreases, which affects the release of arginine vasopressin (arginine vasopressin, vasopressin, and antidiuretic hormone are the same substance). The inhibitory effect is weakened, so vasopressin secretion increases (E wrong).",

If cardiac output is significantly reduced, acute circulatory failure and shock can result (pair C). When pericardial effusion causes cardiac tamponade, ventricular diastole is limited, stroke volume decreases, systolic blood pressure decreases, and blood flow velocity slows down. Therefore, the blood remaining in the aorta at the end of diastole decreases less, and diastolic blood pressure may decrease or remain unchanged (E Wrong, this is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Option E": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Clinical studies have proven that early and adequate application of ACEI can not only relieve symptoms, but also delay the progression of heart failure and reduce mortality in patients with different causes and degrees of heart failure and patients with or without coronary heart disease (pair E). Moreover, the \"China Heart Failure Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines 2014\" states that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the first type of drugs proven to reduce the mortality rate of patients with heart failure, and are recognized as the cornerstone and first-choice drug for the treatment of heart failure. Diuretics (False A) are the cornerstone of symptom improvement in heart failure treatment and are the only drugs that can control fluid retention in heart failure treatment. However, their effect on reducing patient mortality is uncertain. Nitrates (B error) and α-receptor agonists (C error) have no effect on reducing the total mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. Most calcium channel blockers, especially short-acting dihydropyridines and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects, cannot improve symptoms or improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. Short-term treatment can lead to pulmonary edema and In cardiogenic shock, long-term use will worsen cardiac function and increase the risk of death. Amlodipine or felodipine can only be used in patients with chronic heart failure combined with severe hypertension or angina pectoris that cannot be controlled by other drugs. The long-term use of amlodipine and felodipine is relatively safe. Although they cannot improve the survival rate, they have no adverse effect on the prognosis ( D is wrong).",

        "Option E": "Early cardiac hypertrophy is beneficial to maintaining cardiac function",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Ventricular remodeling refers to the adaptive changes in the structure, function, quantity and gene expression of myocardial tissue that occur in a state of sustained overload and excessive activation of nerves and body fluids. When cardiac function is impaired, cardiac load (especially afterload) is excessive, and ventricular wall stress increases, myocardial hypertrophy is often used as the main compensatory mechanism (pair A), which may or may not be accompanied by ventricular enlargement. Because the enlargement and increase of the nucleus and mitochondria lag behind the fibrosis of the myocardium, the energy supply of the myocardium is insufficient, which is manifested as a decrease in the contraction speed of the hypertrophic myocardium and a delay in relaxation (C pair). However, in the early stage, moderate hypertrophy of the myocardium enhances the contractility of the myocardium. When it is sufficient to overcome the ventricular wall stress, cardiac output can meet the body's needs and cardiac function can remain normal (DE pair). In the early stage of ventricular remodeling, due to myocardial hypertrophy, increased sympathetic nerve excitability, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, myocardial contractility increases and ventricular blood output capacity increases (B is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question); late ventricular remodeling , excessive myocardial hypertrophy, relative lack of blood supply to myocardial cells, the contractile proteins produced in myocardial cells will also be converted into immature contractile proteins with poor contraction efficiency due to activation of embryonic genes, and the contractile components in some myocardial fibers will even dissolve disappear, ultimately leading to a decrease in the shortening ability of myocardial fibers and ventricular discharge capacity.",

        "Explanation": "middle-aged female patient has suffered from repeated acid reflux and heartburn for 5 years, which is more obvious when lying down and worsens over the past month, affecting her sleep (a typical manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease). Based on the patient's medical history and clinical manifestations, the most likely diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease. For reflux disease, acid suppression is the key point of treatment. The first choice drug is PPI, such as omeprazole (B pair). PPI is a powerful acid-suppressing drug, which can produce significant and lasting acid-suppressing effect and relieve symptoms quickly. Famotidine (C) is an H₂ receptor antagonist, which significantly inhibits gastric acid secretion at night, but its acid-suppressing effect is weaker than that of PPI. Long-term use will cause drug tolerance. Increasing the dose will also increase adverse reactions. as a first choice.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is mainly stored in the ventricular myocardium. Increased pressure load and activation of the stretch mechanism cause the secretion of natriuretic peptide. Its physiological effects are to dilate blood vessels, increase Na⁺ excretion, and resist the water and sodium retention effects of epinephrine and RAAS systems. , BNP is an important marker reflecting cardiac function (9th edition of Physiology P138). The level of circulating BNP increases in heart failure, and its degree of increase is positively correlated with the severity of heart failure. It can be used as an indicator to evaluate the process and prognosis of heart failure. . Therefore, the most valuable blood biochemical indicator to evaluate the cardiac function of patients after PCI is brain natriuretic peptide BNP (C pair). The appearance and increase of troponin (A) is an indicator of acute necrosis during myocardial infarction, and its dynamic change process is closely related to the time of myocardial infarction, the size of the infarction range, thrombolytic treatment, and reperfusion conditions. Creatine kinase isoenzyme (B error) is also a serum enzymatic indicator for clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

        "Option D": "Requires long-term continuous application",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The biggest complication of atrial fibrillation is thromboembolism, which is the main cause of disability and death in atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation treatment is required whether during atrial fibrillation or before drug or electrical cardioversion. Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation are treated with warfarin for anticoagulation, which needs to be used continuously for a long time (D pair) to maintain the international standard prothrombin time ratio (INR) at 2.0 to 3.0, which can safely and effectively prevent stroke. CHADS₂ score for patients over 80 years old = 1 (according to the CHA₂DS₂VASc score recommended by the new guidelines, age ≥ 75 years old is 2 points). The annual incidence of thromboembolism in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation reaches 5%, which is 6 times that of patients without atrial fibrillation. It is recommended to use warfarin anticoagulation therapy (A is wrong). According to the CHADS₂ score (or CHA₂DS₂VASc score), the atrial diameter is not used as a scoring item, and the application of anticoagulation therapy cannot be determined based solely on the size of the atrial diameter (False B). Patients with concurrent heart failure and a CHADS₂ score = 1 should consider receiving warfarin anticoagulation therapy based on the actual situation rather than reducing the dose (C is wrong). Regarding this scoring system, the ninth edition of Internal Medicine has updated the content (P189). In the past, it was simple and easy to use CHADS₂ scoring, but it was not accurate enough for the evaluation of patients with low risk of stroke. Currently, the CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring system is mostly used in clinical practice.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Sinus arrest is also called sinus rest, sinus pause, sinus pause, etc. Sinus arrest means that the sinoatrial node does not produce impulses during one or more cardiac cycles, so that it cannot excite the atria or the entire heart. The electrocardiogram shows that no P wave occurs during an interval that is significantly longer than the normal PP interval, or neither P wave nor QRS wave appears. There is no multiple relationship between the long PP interval and the basic sinus PP interval (D pair ). The ventricular rate in sinus arrest is not necessarily less than 40 beats/min (wrong A), because lower potential pacemaking points such as the atrioventricular junction can send out a single escape beat or an escape rhythm to control the ventricle after arrest (right B). The large variation in the length of the PP interval does not mean that the long PP interval is longer than 1.5 seconds (C is wrong).

In severe anemia, the oxygen supply to various tissues throughout the body is insufficient, the contractility of the myocardium is enhanced, and the heart rate is accelerated compensatoryly. By increasing the blood supply to the tissues to meet the metabolic needs of the tissues, the long-term overload of the heart eventually leads to myocardial decompensation and high blood output. Heart failure. In hyperthyroidism, thyroid hormone secretion increases, resulting in enhanced myocardial contraction, accelerated heart rate, dilation of peripheral blood vessels, and decreased resistance, resulting in a significant increase in cardiac output. When an arteriovenous fistula occurs, a large amount of arterial blood directly enters the vein through the fistula opening, which increases the amount of venous blood returning to the heart and increases left ventricular filling, resulting in increased blood output. In beriberi, small blood vessels dilate, peripheral vascular resistance decreases, and blood circulation accelerates, which increases venous return and cardiac output.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The electrocardiographic characteristics of second-degree type I atrioventricular block are progressive prolongation of the PR interval (B error), progressive shortening of adjacent RR intervals until one P wave cannot be transmitted down to the ventricle, and the RR including the blocked P wave is smaller than normal. Twice the sinus PP interval (pair C). The most common atrioventricular conduction ratios are 3:2 and 5:4 (D is wrong). Since the sinus node impulse discharge in patients with second-degree type I atrioventricular block is normal, the PP interval is an equal (A error) performance of sinus. According to the basic electrocardiographic characteristics of second-degree type I atrioventricular block, the PR interval is progressively prolonged until one P wave is blocked and cannot be transmitted down to the ventricle.

        "Option E": "The first heart sound at the apex may not be exaggerated",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Mitral stenosis and aortic regurgitation are a common combination of rheumatic heart disease (pair A). Mitral valve stenosis leads to reduced ventricular filling during diastole. Although it is accompanied by aortic blood regurgitation, the early increase in left ventricular preload is not serious, so left ventricular enlargement is delayed (pair B). Clinically, about 2/3 of patients with severe mitral stenosis are accompanied by varying degrees of aortic regurgitation (pair C). Aortic regurgitation and ventricular overfilling cause the mitral valve to be in a higher position and the mitral valve closing amplitude to be smaller during ventricular systole, so the first heart sound at the apex may not be exaggerated (pair E). Peripheral vascular signs are manifestations of increased pulse pressure. Mitral valve stenosis limits left ventricular diastolic filling, reduces systolic stroke volume, reduces cardiac output, and significantly reduces systolic blood pressure. At this time, although aortic reflux exists and diastolic blood pressure decreases, the pulse pressure does not change much, so peripheral vascular signs cannot be absent (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). As cardiac output increases, systolic blood pressure increases, and peripheral vascular signs should be typical.",

L), indicating that the patient is likely to be complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Common complications of DKA include shock, severe infection, heart failure, renal failure, cerebral edema, etc. Among them, cerebral edema is often related to cerebral hypoxia, improper alkali or fluid replenishment, and rapid drop in blood sugar. If after treatment, blood sugar drops and acidosis improves, but coma worsens, you should be alert to the possibility of cerebral edema. After rescue and intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate, the patient's blood sugar dropped, his consciousness improved, and his acidosis was alleviated, but he soon fell into coma again.

        "Option D": "Anterior wall combined with high lateral wall myocardial infarction",
        "Option E": "High lateral wall combined with posterior lateral wall myocardial infarction",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The prognosis of acute myocardial infarction is related to the infarct size and the presence of serious complications. When myocardial infarction is accompanied by complications such as third-degree atrioventricular block, there will be a serious lack of ventricular ejection volume, which is obviously more serious than a simple myocardial infarction (CDE is wrong). Anterior wall myocardial infarction is usually caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and its branches, while inferior wall myocardial infarction is usually caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery. Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and its branches can also cause infarction in the apex, anteroseptal wall, anterolateral wall and other parts, so the risk is much greater than inferior wall myocardial infarction (A is wrong to B). In addition, according to the characteristics of the myocardium, the front wall of the myocardium is the thinnest, the lower wall of the myocardium is thicker, and the upper and posterior side walls are thicker. Therefore, severe complications such as cardiac rupture that can lead to sudden death are prone to occur when the front wall myocardial infarction occurs. And the area of the anterior wall is larger. When third-degree atrioventricular block occurs, it means that the infarction range is larger and the ventricular function is severely reduced. It is the most dangerous situation for acute myocardial infarction.",

        "Question": "Which of the following is not an indicator of myocardial infarction?",
        "Option A": "Decreased serum myosin light chain",
        "Option B": "Increased serum myosin heavy chain",
        "Option C": "Increased troponin I",
        "Option D": "Increased myoglobin",
        "Option E": "Increased creatine kinase",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Myoginsin light chain (CMLC) mainly exists in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle and is a structural component of myofibrillar contractile proteins. When the myocardium is damaged, myosin dissociates, and the myosin light chain has a small molecular weight and easily escapes out of the cell, and is stable in the blood. Therefore, during myocardial infarction, the serum myosin light chain increases (A is wrong, for The correct answer to this question). Indicators of acute myocardial infarction: 1. Elevated serum myosin heavy chain (pair B): Myosin heavy chain (MHC) is the main component of sarcomeric heavy filaments, and the MHC (myosin heavy chain) of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle ) composition determines its contraction speed, which is related to the activity of the ATPase of myofibrillar myosin at different pH levels. When the myocardium is damaged, myosin heavy chain (MHC) enters the blood, so MHC increases; 2. Serum troponin increases: troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) 3 to 4 hours after onset then rises (C pair), cTnI reaches a peak at 11 to 24 hours, and drops to normal in 7 to 10 days, cTnT reaches a peak at 24 to 48 hours, and drops to normal at 10 to 14 days; 3. Increased serum myoglobin (pair D): increases within 2 hours after the onset of illness and reaches a peak within 12 hours; returns to normal within 24 to 48 hours; 4. Increased serum creatine kinase isoenzyme CK-MB (pair E): It increases within 4 hours after the onset of illness, reaches a peak at 16 to 24 hours, and returns to normal in 3 to 4 days. The degree of increase can more accurately reflect infarction. range. The previous real question believed that CK is not equivalent to CK-MB, and option E of this question is controversial.",

        "Option E": "The adverse reactions of loop diuretics are mostly caused by the diuretic effect",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Thiazides, especially hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg/d, have reached their maximum effect (the dose-response curve has reached a plateau), and further increases are ineffective (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). Potassium-sparing diuretics (Pair A) are often used in combination with potassium-excreting diuretics such as thiazides and loop diuretics to enhance the diuretic effect and prevent hypokalemia. The diuretic effect is weak and can be used continuously for a long time. Thiazide diuretics are the first choice for mild heart failure, but they can inhibit uric acid excretion and cause hyperuricemia, and long-term high-dose use can affect sugar and lipid metabolism. Therefore, thiazides or loop diuretics should be used intermittently in mild cases ( B right). Thiazides are only suitable for patients with heart failure who have mild fluid retention, hypertension and normal renal function. Loop diuretics (C pair) should be used when heart failure is accompanied by renal insufficiency. They act on the Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ co-transporter in the thick ascending branch of the medullary loop, reducing the concentration and dilution functions of the kidneys, and their diuretic effect Powerful and unaffected by changes in the body's acid-base balance. There is a linear relationship between the dose and effect of furosemide, and the dose is not limited. However, large doses are not recommended clinically. Excessive dosage may easily lead to volume deficiency and increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency (pair E).",

It is common in aortic valve regurgitation, hyperthyroidism and other diseases that cause increased pulse pressure. (E pair). The pathogenesis of finger clubbing is still unclear, but it is generally believed to be related to major factors such as insufficient arterial blood oxygenation and increased blood flow. About 1/3 of patients with subacute endocarditis have finger clubbing (A is wrong). Osler's node (B error) mainly originates from the deposition of immune complexes in the body, which triggers the body's immune response, causing local edema, inflammatory redness and swelling, and stimulating peripheral pain nerves, resulting in a certain sense of pain.

Generally, clinical symptoms only occur when the mitral valve has moderate stenosis (valve area <1.5cm²). symptom. Regardless of whether the mitral valve is stenotic or not, during ventricular diastole, there is a pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle, that is, the transvalvular pressure difference, which is the direct driving force for blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. After early filling, the pressures in the left atrium and left ventricle tend to be equal. During mitral valve stenosis, left ventricular filling is blocked, and the pressure difference lasts throughout the ventricular diastole. Therefore, the degree of mitral valve stenosis can be judged by measuring the transvalvular pressure difference. Even in mild mitral valve stenosis, the transvalvular pressure difference still exists ( D is wrong). Compensatory hypertrophy and expansion of the left atrium (E error) in the later stages of mitral stenosis may develop into left atrial failure.

Its anatomical basis is the atrioventricular accessory pathway (bundle of Kent), and others include the atrioventricular bundle, nodal ventricular fibers, and branch ventricular fibers. The application of intracardiac electrophysiological examination (D pair) can understand the type, origin and pathogenesis of arrhythmia. In addition, it can also be used for treatment and prognosis.

        "Explanation": "The treatment of patients with preexcitation syndrome without tachycardia or atrial fibrillation is still controversial, and risk stratification is needed to decide whether to receive catheter ablation treatment (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). For patients with preexcitation syndrome accompanied by forward atrioventricular reentry tachycardia, intravenous injection of verapamil (A pair) or adenosine is the first choice, or propafenone can be used to reduce the ventricular rate by terminating atrioventricular intranodal reentry. . For patients with pre-excitation syndrome accompanied by atrial fibrillation, antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide (Class IA) or propafenone (Class IC) that prolong the refractory period of the atrioventricular accessory pathway (pair B) should be used. Frequent episodes of tachycardia are an indication for radiofrequency ablation (pair C). The pathological basis of pre-excitation syndrome is the existence of atrioventricular accessory pathways between the atria and ventricles. Ventricular pre-excitation, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are the most common tachyarrhythmias. Pre-excitation syndrome The main prevention is to prevent the recurrence of tachycardia. In order to effectively prevent repeated episodes of tachycardia, two antiarrhythmic drugs should be used to simultaneously inhibit the forward and retrograde conduction of the reentrant circuit (E pair). Clinically, quinidine Combination with propranolol, procaine and verapamil can achieve better therapeutic effects. Class IA and IC antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone prolong the irregular connection between the atrioventricular accessory pathway and the atrioventricular node, which can effectively prevent the recurrence of tachycardia. Drug selection can be based on the actual clinical situation (electrophysiological examination can determine the most effective drugs to ensure the best relapse prevention effect).",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a group of clinical syndromes caused by acute myocardial ischemia. The main pathological basis is the rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques leading to intracoronary thrombosis. When the patient has severe chest pain and myocardial ischemia, CK-MB (A error), troponin (B error), and echocardiography (C error) can all appear normal; in acute myocardial infarction, serum myocardial necrosis markers Abnormalities also have a process, such as troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) increases 3 to 4 hours after onset, and CK-MB (creatine kinase isoenzyme) increases within 4 hours after onset. Therefore, normal results of the above examinations do not exclude the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (including acute myocardial infarction). Compared with the 12-lead ECG, the 18-lead ECG has additional right chest leads and posterior chest wall leads, which can more fully reflect the electrophysiological activity of the heart. Obvious abnormal changes will appear in the early stage of myocardial cell ischemia.

        "Option E": "Frequent urination, urgency, and painful urination",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Rheumatic valvular heart disease refers to heart disease mainly caused by heart valve disease left over from rheumatic carditis. Infectious endocarditis often occurs when carditis leads to mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation. Infective endocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart valves or ventricular wall lining caused by direct infection by bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. Almost all patients have fever at the time of onset, but there are generally no obvious fever symptoms in the inactive phase of rheumatic valvular heart disease. Therefore, for patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease who have unexplained fever for more than 1 week, they should consider whether they are complicated by infective endocarditis (pair D). Rheumatic valvular heart disease itself can cause symptoms such as arrhythmia (error A), heart failure (error B), paroxysmal precordial pain (error C), etc. Therefore, the presence of the above symptoms in patients does not indicate combined infectious intracardiac disease. inflammation.

        "Option E": "The murmur does not conduct to the left edge of the sternum and the base of the heart",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Due to the shortened left ventricular ejection period, the aortic valve closes prematurely, and the second heart sound component caused by the aortic valve closure is premature (A error). In patients with mitral regurgitation and severe regurgitation, the third heart sound (B error) and a brief diastolic rumble-like murmur can be heard in the apical area. Due to mitral regurgitation, the isovolumetric contraction phase in the early phase of left ventricular contraction does not exist, and blood flow can reflux to the left atrium during ventricular depolarization and increased muscle tone. Therefore, the murmur can appear at the same time as the first heart sound, and can Mask the first heart sound (pair C). The murmur of mitral regurgitation is a high-pitched consistent murmur like a holosystolic blow, rather than an increasing pattern (D error). When mitral regurgitation occurs, the anterior leaflet is damaged and the murmur is mainly conducted to the left axilla or under the left scapula. When the posterior leaflet is damaged, the murmur is mainly conducted to the bottom of the heart (E error).",

        "Explanation": "The cardiovascular system of Graves' disease is characterized by hyperdynamic circulation. Almost all patients are accompanied by sustained sinus tachycardia. The heart rate is usually 90 to 120 beats/min (normal 60 to 100 beats/min). When resting or sleeping, Still higher than normal (A is wrong). The most common arrhythmias caused by Graves' disease are premature atrial contractions, followed by paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation (B error). Graves' disease is characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, increased left ventricular preload, and enlarged cardiac chambers, which can cause relative mitral valve insufficiency, so systolic murmurs rather than diastolic murmurs can often be heard (wrong C). Long-term hyperdynamic circulation can cause compensatory myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial hypertrophy in the early stage. In the late stage, the heart decompensates, myocardial cells appear necrosis and fibrosis, and cardiac enlargement occurs (D pair). Patients with Graves' disease have enhanced myocardial contractility and increased cardiac output, leading to an increase in systolic blood pressure; patients with Graves' disease have an elevated body temperature and compensatory relaxation of peripheral blood vessels to promote heat dissipation, so peripheral vascular resistance decreases and diastolic blood pressure often decreases (E is wrong) .",

Its principle of action is that during cardiac diastole, the balloon is inflated, aortic diastolic pressure and coronary artery pressure increase, increasing blood and oxygen supply to the myocardium; before cardiac contraction, the balloon is deflated, aortic pressure decreases, and cardiac afterload decreases. Cardiac ejection resistance decreases and myocardial oxygen consumption decreases. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is mainly used for cardiogenic shock (A pair) caused by heart disease, refractory angina, severe aortic lesions or severe vascular lesions that require acute interventional treatment or surgery. Intravesicular counterpulsation (IABP) is currently one of the most effective supportive treatments for cardiogenic shock. Left ventricular failure (error B), malignant arrhythmia (error C), right ventricular infarction (error D), and chronic renal insufficiency (error E) are not indications for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.",

        "Option E": "Chest X-ray may not show an upward curved effusion shadow",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "small amount of pleural effusion may have no obvious symptoms or only chest pain, and the pain worsens with breathing movements; when the effusion volume is 300 to 500 mL, there may be no clinical symptoms (A pair); when the pleural effusion exceeds 300 to 500 ml, you may feel chest tightness or Shortness of breath; as the pleural effusion increases, chest tightness and shortness of breath gradually worsen; when there is a large amount of pleural effusion, dyspnea and palpitations may occur. A small amount of pleural effusion is difficult to detect on chest X-ray. When the effusion volume reaches 300 to 500 ml, chest X-ray examination shows that the costophrenic angle becomes blunt (BE pair). As the pleural effusion increases, a curved effusion shadow with a concave surface upward and a high outer side and a low inner side is displayed. B-ultrasound has high sensitivity in detecting pleural effusion and accurate positioning. It is the most sensitive non-invasive diagnostic method for detecting pleural effusion (D pair). CT or PET/CT can display pleural effusion and intrapulmonary lesions, pleural mesothelioma, intrathoracic or pleural metastatic tumors, mediastinal and paratracheal lymph nodes and other lesions, which is helpful for etiological diagnosis and plays an important role in indicating the nature of effusion.

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Except for capillaries, all other types of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, precapillary sphincter, etc., are innervated by sympathetic constrictor nerve fibers (pair A). In some organs and tissues, vascular smooth muscles often maintain a certain tonic contraction, a phenomenon called myogenic activity. The tonic contraction activity of the smooth muscle of the vein wall increases when the vein is dilated (pair B). Veins are also called capacity vessels. In a resting state, the venous system can accommodate 60% to 70% of the body's circulating blood volume (pair C). Changes in body position will lead to the redistribution of blood. For example, when the human body changes from a supine position to an upright position, a large amount of blood accumulates in the lower limbs and the amount of blood returned to the heart decreases (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The veins have high distensibility and have low resistance to blood flow (E pair), so the blood returns from the venules to the right atrium and the pressure is only reduced by about 15mmHg.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an unexplained disease characterized by progressive myocardial hypertrophy and progressive narrowing of the ventricular cavity (A is incorrect, the correct answer to this question). The basic pathological characteristics are obstruction of left ventricular blood filling and decreased diastolic compliance. Cardiac disease. Due to the stenosis of the left ventricular outflow tract in hypertrophic heart disease, a systolic ejection murmur may occur in the middle and lower left sternal border. When performing the Valsalva maneuver, the amount of blood returned to the heart is reduced, the stenosis of the left ventricular outflow tract is more obvious, and the murmur is enhanced (pair B) . In cases with outflow tract obstruction, the interventricular septal outflow tract part protrudes into the left ventricle and the anterior mitral valve leaflet moves forward during systole (SAM) (pair C). Beta-receptor antagonists are first-line treatments for obstructive HCM (D pair).

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When mitral stenosis is associated with atrial fibrillation, the most common complication is heart failure (pair D). In mitral stenosis, ventricular filling depends on the duration of diastole. In atrial fibrillation, the increased heart rate leads to shortened diastolic filling time, reduced left ventricular filling, and reduced cardiac output. In atrial fibrillation, atrial systolic function is lost in late diastole, further reducing left ventricular filling and lowering cardiac output. These two factors can reduce cardiac output by 20% to 25%, leading to heart failure. Mitral valve stenosis rarely causes angina (False A), and angina is a common symptom of aortic valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis combined with atrial fibrillation often forms mural thrombi, which can cause systemic circulation embolism rather than pulmonary embolism after detachment (B error). Mitral stenosis accompanied by atrial fibrillation does not cause rapid pericardial effusion, so cardiac tamponade generally does not occur (C error).

        "Explanation": "The effect of β-blockers on cardiac function is bidirectional. In the short term, it has a negative inotropic effect on the heart. Long-term use can slow down the heart rate, prolong left ventricular filling time, increase myocardial perfusion, and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. \"Biological effects\" that improve endogenous myocardial function. The use of beta-blockers can cause fluid retention, but usually there are no symptoms, only weight gain, which may eventually lead to significant worsening of heart failure symptoms. Therefore, constant weight (E pair) is the main factor affecting its efficacy, starting from Before treatment, it should be confirmed that the patient has reached a dry weight state, and the body weight should be measured during medication and the dose of diuretics should be adjusted in a timely manner. The use of beta-blockers when fluid retention can worsen heart failure; the use of beta-blockers when fluids are insufficient can cause hypotension. Factors such as age (False A), gender (False B), and blood lipid levels (False C) have no significant impact on the efficacy of beta-blockers. In the past, it was believed that beta-blockers could mask early symptoms of hypoglycemia and were not used in the treatment of patients with diabetes.

        "Explanation": "Bleeding time refers to the time it takes for blood to flow out naturally and stop naturally after artificially puncturing the skin under certain conditions. This is a common measurement test that reflects the hemostatic function of capillary walls and platelets. The common measurement method for bleeding time is Duke's method. (normal value 1~3min), IVY method (normal value 2~7min) and TBT method (normal value 2.3~9.5min). Coagulation time refers to the time it takes for blood to leave the blood vessel and coagulate outside the body. It is mainly used to measure endogenous Whether various coagulation factors in the sexual coagulation pathway are lacking, whether their functions are normal, or whether there is an increase in anticoagulant substances. Commonly used methods for measuring coagulation time include the glass tube method (normal value 4 to 12 minutes) and the plastic tube method (normal value 10 to 19 minutes ), silicon tube method (normal value 15-32 minutes), etc. From the normal value, the bleeding time is obviously shorter than the coagulation time (D pair). Platelets participate in both the hemostatic process and the coagulation process. However, when thrombocytopenia occurs, the hemostatic time is generally prolonged and the coagulation time is normal. This is because platelets play a core role in the hemostatic process (the formation of platelet hemostatic plugs), and the bleeding time itself is A test used to measure the hemostatic function of platelets. Platelets provide a phospholipid surface for the activation of coagulation factors during the coagulation process. The number of platelets required in the coagulation process is very small, and fewer platelets generally do not affect the length of the coagulation time (E is wrong, for The correct answer to this question). The causes of local vascular reactions include reflexive vasoconstriction caused by damaging stimuli, vascular myogenic contraction caused by damage to the vascular wall, and the release of vasoconstrictor substances such as 5-HT and TXA₂ by platelets adhering to the injured area. However, these factors have a limited duration of action. , the local vascular reaction lasts shorter (pair C).",

        "Explanation": "The outlet pathways of intracellular pyruvate include hydrogenation to generate lactate, carboxylation to generate oxaloacetate, and oxidative decarboxylation to generate acetyl-CoA, etc. Among them, oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA is the main outlet, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and its coenzyme Including thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoic acid, FAD, NAD⁺ and CoA, which can be remembered as (coenzyme A) exchange (TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate) when going to the United States (TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate), lipoic acid (FAD, yellow) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (NAD⁺, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (can also be remembered as SPA, that is, with the letters S, P, and A in the name. Note: the chemical symbol of sulfur is S ), lack of these coenzymes, pyruvate will not be decarboxylated to generate acetyl-CoA, so the lack of thiamine (B pair) can cause the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to be blocked, resulting in the accumulation of pyruvate. It is worth noting that NAD⁺ is the active form of vitamin PP in the body. When vitamin PP is deficient, NAD⁺ is also deficient, which can also cause the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to be blocked and promote the accumulation of pyruvate. However, in the more upstream glycolysis stage, The dehydrogenation reaction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate also uses NAD⁺ as a coenzyme. If NAD⁺ is lacking, the glycolysis pathway is blocked, that is, the production of pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, is blocked, so vitamin PP is lacking (NAD⁺ deficiency ), it will not cause accumulation of pyruvate in the body.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Syncope refers to a brief state of loss of consciousness caused by transient widespread insufficient blood supply to the brain. Syncope can be roughly divided into 4 categories, including: 1. Vasomotor disorders, seen in simple syncope, orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus syndrome (A pair), urinary syncope, cough syncope and painful syncope; 2. Cardiogenic syncope, seen in severe arrhythmias, blocked cardiac output, myocardial ischemia, etc., such as paroxysmal tachycardia, prolonged QT syndrome, high-grade atrioventricular block, etc., the most serious of which are A-S syndrome (False D); 3. Cerebral syncope, seen in transient ischemic attacks, pulseless syndrome, migraine, etc.; 4. Abnormal blood components, seen in hypoglycemic syndrome (False C), ventilation Hyperventilation syndrome (B error), crying syncope, severe anemia, etc. Stimulating the carotid sinus in patients with carotid sinus syndrome will cause vagus nerve excitation, which reflexively causes peripheral blood vessel dilation, reduced blood return and cardiac output, resulting in transient cerebral blood supply insufficiency and syncope. Under normal conditions, the energy supply to the brain comes from glucose. In patients with hypoglycemic syndrome, blood sugar decreases and brain cells experience metabolic disorders, leading to brain dysfunction and syncope. Adams syndrome refers to the sudden onset of severe, fatal slow or tachyarrhythmia, which causes cardiac output to decrease sharply in a short period of time, causing symptoms such as severe cerebral ischemia, loss of consciousness, and syncope. Hyperventilation syndrome is a group of syndromes caused by abnormal regulation of the respiratory center and excessive ventilation exceeding physiological metabolic needs. It often manifests as dyspnea, numbness of limbs, dizziness, and in severe cases, symptoms such as syncope and convulsions.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "After patients in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic pulmonary heart disease use diuretics, potassium ion excretion increases, and the body becomes hypokalemic and hypochloric. When potassium is low, the H⁺-K⁺ exchange is enhanced, K⁺ enters the outside of the cell, and H⁺ enters the cell, causing alkalosis. At the same time, due to the diuretic effect, the excretion of H⁺ increases, which increases the reabsorption of bicarbonate, and the carbonic acid in the body The level of hydrogen radicals increases. Since the sum of the main anions in the blood, bicarbonate and chloride ions, is relatively constant, the chloride ions decrease accordingly. Therefore, hypokalemia and hypochloride alkalosis are likely to occur after using diuretics (pair A). Patients with chronic cor pulmonale have respiratory dysfunction and may experience CO₂ retention, resulting in respiratory acidosis rather than respiratory alkalosis (D is wrong). Because CO₂ retention develops slowly, the kidneys can maintain a constant pH by reducing the elimination of HCO₃⁻. However, when CO₂ in the body increases for a long time, HCO₃⁻ is also maintained at a high level, leading to respiratory acidosis combined with metabolic alkalosis. Rather than metabolic acidosis (B is wrong). If acute respiratory failure occurs, the kidneys cannot buffer in time, so the acidic substances in the body will increase, resulting in respiratory acidosis combined with metabolic acidosis (C error). However, diuretics will not cause dilution when chronic pulmonary heart disease is acutely exacerbated. hyponatremia (E wrong).",

The elderly often suffer from arteriosclerosis, reduced vascular elasticity and reduced blood storage, and reduced sensitivity of baroreceptors in regulating blood pressure (right D). Therefore, blood pressure fluctuates greatly (wrong A, the correct answer to this question), and orthostatic hypotension is prone to occur (C Right) (Orthostatic hypotension, also called orthostatic hypotension, is low blood pressure caused by changes in body position. It is generally believed that when the systolic blood pressure drops by 20mmHg after standing compared with the supine position or the diastolic blood pressure drops by 10mmHg, it is orthostatic hypotension. ). Hypertension in the elderly is often accompanied by varying degrees of damage to the heart, kidneys, brain and other organs, and they are more prone to cardiac insufficiency (pair B). The elasticity of blood vessels in the elderly decreases, and the large arteries cannot expand accordingly during ventricular systole, resulting in a significant increase in systolic blood pressure.

The outer membrane has high permeability to substances and low selectivity. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains a transporter system related to metabolite transport, which selectively transports various substances. NADH (A error) generated in the cytoplasm needs to enter the mitochondria through the α-glycerol phosphate shuttle (brain and skeletal muscle) or the malate-aspartate shuttle (liver and cardiac muscle) for electron transport. Oxaloacetate (B error) needs to be reduced to malic acid through the action of malate dehydrogenase, or to generate aspartic acid through the action of aspartate aminotransferase and enter the cytoplasm from the mitochondria for gluconeogenesis (P112). Fatty acyl-CoA (C) needs to be catalyzed by carnitine acyltransferase and assisted by carnitine to enter the mitochondria for β-oxidation (P150). In the α-glycerol phosphate shuttle of NADH, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (D pair) serves as an electron donor and can shuttle freely between mitochondria and cytosol to ensure that the cycle continues.

It is common in acute pleurisy (A pair), pleural malignant tumors, rib fractures, and chest trauma. Diabetic ketosis (False B), congestive heart failure (False C), and bronchial asthma (False D) do not cause sudden interruption of the inspiratory phase due to severe pain in the chest, so they are not suppressed breathing. Diabetic ketosis often manifests as deep breathing (Kussmaul breathing). Congestive heart failure often manifests as Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Bronchial asthma (P29) often presents with expiratory dyspnea accompanied by wheezing.",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The person being measured should rest quietly for at least 5 minutes, refrain from smoking 30 minutes before the measurement, and empty the bladder (A is wrong). Regardless of the patient's position, the sphygmomanometer should be placed at heart level. Therefore, when in the supine position, the measured right upper limb is placed flat at the level of the midaxillary line (pair B). Tie the cuff tightly to the subject's upper arm, and its lower edge should be about 2.5cm above the cubital fossa (C wrong). After the examiner feels the pulse of the brachial artery, he places the stethoscope body on the pulse and prepares for auscultation. When measuring, inflate quickly until the pressure in the balloon disappears and rises by another 30mmHg (D is wrong). Deflate it slowly, look at the surface of the mercury column with both eyes, and read the blood pressure value based on the auscultation results. The value when you first hear the loud clicking sound represents systolic blood pressure, and the value when the sound disappears represents diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure should be measured at least twice, with an interval of 1 to 2 minutes; if the difference between systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure is greater than 5mmHg, the blood pressure should be measured again, and the average of the three readings should be taken as the measurement result.",

        "Explanation": "Antidiuretic hormone, also known as vasopressin, is a polypeptide hormone rather than a protein hormone that is synthesized by neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and transported to the neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary gland) for storage via the hypothalamic-pituitary tract. (Eighth Edition Biochemistry P11: More than 50 amino acid residues are proteins, and less than 50 amino acid residues are polypeptides) (AB is wrong). Antidiuretic hormone has two receptors, V₁ and V₂. V₁ receptors are distributed in vascular smooth muscle, and V₂ receptors are distributed on the basal side of the main cells of the renal collecting duct (P257). Therefore, antidiuretic hormone mainly acts on the renal collecting duct, not near the renal collecting duct. Convoluted tubules (C wrong). The release of antidiuretic hormone is regulated and affected by multiple factors, the most important of which are body fluid osmotic pressure and blood volume: when body fluid osmotic pressure decreases, hypothalamic osmoreceptor stimulation decreases, and antidiuretic hormone secretion also decreases (E is wrong); When blood volume increases, the volume of venous return to the heart increases, which can stimulate cardiopulmonary receptors, increase the impulse transmitted to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve, and inhibit the release of antidiuretic hormone (D pair).",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "In pericardial effusion, heart failure (heart failure not caused by volume overload), and aortic stenosis, cardiac stroke volume decreases and systolic blood pressure decreases significantly. Because the arterial pressure is significantly lowered and the blood flow velocity is slowed, the amount of blood remaining in the large arteries at the end of ventricular diastole is not much reduced, so the decrease in diastolic blood pressure is relatively small, and therefore the pulse pressure decreases. In severe mitral regurgitation, although cardiac stroke volume is also reduced and systolic blood pressure is significantly reduced, severe systolic regurgitation greatly shortens the systolic period, and the increased left atrial volume load caused by regurgitation reduces the diastolic period. Prolonged, the blood flow from the aorta to the periphery increases during diastole, and the diastolic blood pressure decreases more obviously than the systolic blood pressure, so the pulse pressure increases (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

At this time, the patient's LVEF ≥ 50%, usually with left ventricular Hypertrophy or enlargement of the left atrium is now called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It is common in hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (C pair), aortic stenosis and constrictive pericarditis. The cardiac changes caused by long-term hypertension are mainly left ventricular hypertrophy and enlargement. However, it should be noted that in the early stage of hypertensive heart disease, only the ventricular filling volume is reduced, but with the changes in myocardial metabolism, function and structure, it will eventually develop into contraction and contraction. Diastolic dysfunction. Acute myocardial infarction (Error A) and dilated cardiomyopathy (Error B) can both lead to cardiac systolic dysfunction, decreased cardiac output and circulatory congestion, generally leading to systolic heart failure.

        "Explanation": "High-output heart failure is common in severe anemia, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, systemic arteriovenous fistula, beriberi (vitamin B₁ deficiency) and other diseases (memory formula \"Move your feet to evaluate people\"). At this time, peripheral vascular resistance decreases and blood pressure increases. The volume expands or the circulation speed increases, the venous return increases, and the heart is overfilled, putting the body in a high-dynamic circulation state. Patients usually have significantly lower diastolic blood pressure, so the pulse pressure (the difference between systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) increases significantly (pair A). Severe anemia, hyperthyroidism and other diseases accompanied by an increase in systemic circulating blood volume increase the heart's capacity load, compensatory expansion of the ventricular cavity in the early stage, and compensated myocardial contractile function, but it will appear after the changes in the structure and function of the heart exceed a certain limit. Congestive heart failure and less common total heart failure (B is wrong). When the volume load of high-displacement heart failure increases and the ventricle enlarges, the ventricular compliance increases. Even if there is ventricular hypertrophy, simple diastolic heart failure will not occur (C wrong). Simple diastolic heart failure is more common in the early stages of cardiac dysfunction in coronary heart disease and hypertensive heart disease.

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Second heart sound splitting in the heart is divided into two categories: normal second heart sound splitting and pathological second heart sound splitting. Under normal circumstances, the diastolic phases of the left and right ventricles are not completely synchronized. During inspiration, there is more blood reflux in the right heart, the emptying time of the right ventricle is long, and the closure of the pulmonary valve is further delayed, while the reflux in the left heart does not increase, which can cause the aortic valve of the second heart sound to The distance between the component and the pulmonary valve component increases, and when it is greater than 0.03, a split second heart sound is heard. It can split and disappear when exhaling. It is best heard by teenagers and children in the 2nd and 3rd intercostal space on the left edge of the sternum. Atrial septal defect (A pair) with congenital heart disease often has fixed S₂ split (9th edition of Diagnostics P151), that is, the split is not affected by inhalation and expiration, and the time interval between the two components of S₂ split is relatively fixed. The reasons are as follows: exhalation When inhaling, the blood volume returned to the heart by the right atrium decreases, but due to the blood shunt from the left atrium to the right atrium, the blood volume in the right heart still increases, the blood ejection time is prolonged, and the pulmonary valve closure is significantly delayed; when inhaling, the blood return volume increases, but The temporary increase in right atrial pressure also causes a slight decrease in left-to-right shunt, which basically offsets the increase in right heart blood flow caused by inspiration. Abnormal cleavage is also called reverse cleavage (Ninth Edition of Diagnostics P151), which means that the aortic valve closes later than the pulmonary valve, and the aortic valve narrows during inhalation and widens during expiration. Abnormal splitting of S₂ is a pathological sign, seen in complete left bundle branch block (C error), aortic stenosis (D error), and severe hypertension. Acute extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction (B error) can lead to left bundle branch block and cause abnormal S₂ splitting.",

        "Explanation": "Bronchial asthma is an obstructive ventilatory disorder characterized by airflow limitation. In mild lesions, due to the increased resistance of gas passing through the airways, the oxygen entering the alveoli decreases, the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood decreases, stimulating the carotid artery chemoreceptors, reflexively prompting breathing to deepen and accelerate, hyperventilation leads to a decrease in PaCO₂, and respiratory alkalinity occurs. Poisoned. As the condition worsens (C is true and AE is wrong), the trachea and bronchi contract excessively, the airway resistance further increases, the difficulty in expiration worsens, the partial pressure of blood oxygen further decreases, and CO₂ is retained. Therefore, an increase in PaCO₂ can indicate the deterioration of the condition. Increased PaCO₂ is respiratory acidosis (B is wrong). An increase in PaCO₂ does not indicate that the patient has heart failure (D is wrong).",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Studies in recent years have shown that if patients with persistent atrial fibrillation choose to slow down the ventricular rate and pay attention to the prevention of thromboembolism, the prognosis is not significantly different from that of patients who maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion, and it is simpler and easier to implement. Digitalis can inhibit the cardiac conduction system, and the inhibition is most obvious in the atrioventricular junction area. By slowing down the conduction velocity of the atrioventricular node, extending its effective refractory period, and reducing the ventricular rate, it is beneficial to improve cardiac function. Therefore, in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation, the main purpose of applying digitalis is to control the ventricular rate (A pair). Digitalis has no function in converting atrial fibrillation (Error B), nor does it prevent ventricular arrhythmias (Error C). Conversion of atrial fibrillation rhythm is divided into drug conversion and electrical conversion. Amiodarone is the first choice for drug conversion. If electrical conversion is chosen, antiarrhythmic drugs, such as propafenone and amiodarone, should be started a few days before electrical cardioversion to increase the success rate of electrical conversion and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation after cardioversion. However, it should be noted that patients who have taken digitalis should not receive electrical cardioversion therapy (False D) (P193) because digitalis can delay atrioventricular conduction.",

        "Option E": "When combined with heart failure, if there is an increase in blood oxygen saturation, there are indications for the use of diuretics",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Type II respiratory failure is mainly due to insufficient alveolar ventilation, resulting in reduced blood oxygen and respiratory acidosis. Therefore, respiratory acidosis can be corrected by keeping the respiratory tract open, reducing respiratory resistance, and increasing alveolar ventilation (pair A). PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) can reopen collapsed small airways and alveoli, prevent alveoli from opening and closing repeatedly with the respiratory cycle, increase end-expiratory lung capacity, reduce lung damage, and improve alveolar ventilation function (P133) (B Right) to treat respiratory failure. Respiratory stimulants excite the respiratory center by stimulating peripheral or central chemoreceptors under the premise that respiratory muscle function is normal, improve the efficiency of respiratory muscles, increase pulmonary ventilation, and treat respiratory failure. They are mainly suitable for central suppression and ventilation. Respiratory failure caused by insufficient volume should not be used for respiratory failure mainly caused by pulmonary ventilation dysfunction. When the respiratory muscles are diseased, the treatment effect is poor; interstitial fibrosis is mainly manifested as ventilation disorders. Respiratory stimulants cannot improve the symptoms. Instead, they overwork the respiratory muscles and increase oxygen consumption, so they should not be used (C is wrong, this is the question) correct answer). For respiratory failure with obvious CO₂ retention, continuous low-flow oxygen administration (concentration <35%, flow rate 1-2L/min, more than 10 hours a day, maintaining PaO₂≥60mmHg, SaO₂≥90%) (P143) (D pair) . When combined with heart failure, the heart failure can generally be improved after actively controlling infection, clearing the respiratory tract, improving respiratory function, and correcting hypoxia and carbon dioxide retention. If the patient still has symptoms such as edema and oliguria, the patient can be treated with blood oxygen saturation. On the basis of elevated heart rate, diuretics should be used appropriately to eliminate edema and reduce right ventricular preload (E pair).",

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The chest injury that may cause mediastinal flutter is an open pneumothorax (pair A). This is because in an open pneumothorax, external air can freely enter and exit the pleural cavity through the chest wall defect with breathing, and the atmospheric pressure in the pleural cavity on the injured side is significantly high. On the unaffected side, the mediastinum shifts toward the unaffected side, causing the lung expansion on the unaffected side to be significantly restricted. At this time, when inhaling, the mediastinum moves toward the unaffected side, and when exhaling, it moves back toward the affected side. This kind of mediastinal fluttering occurs. Movement and displacement will affect the amount of blood returned to the heart by the vena cava and cause circulatory disorders. In closed pneumothorax (B error), the intrapleural pressure is still lower than the atmospheric pressure. Its symptoms are related to the amount and speed of air accumulation in the pleural cavity. The intrapleural pressure on the affected side increases and the mediastinum shifts to the healthy side (P249). Tension pneumothorax (C error) is a valve formed in the chest wall injury, and the intrathoracic pressure on the affected side progressively increases, higher than the atmospheric pressure, also known as high-pressure pneumothorax. The lung on the injured side is severely collapsed, and the mediastinum shifts to the healthy side (P250 ). Progressive hemothorax (D error) manifests as continuous bleeding in the chest, weakened respiratory movement of the chest on the injured side, widening of the intercostal space, fullness of the chest, displacement of the trachea to the healthy side, weakened or even disappeared breath sounds, and dullness on percussion, requiring timely thoracotomy. Exploration and surgical hemostasis can coexist with closed pneumothorax, open pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax (P251).",

        "Explanation": "In hypertensive emergencies, excessively high blood pressure should be treated promptly and correctly to alleviate the condition as soon as possible, prevent progressive or irreversible target organ damage, and reduce mortality. The treatment principles include the following points: ① Reduce blood pressure in a timely manner: select appropriate and effective antihypertensive drugs for intravenous drip administration (Pair A), and monitor blood pressure at the same time. ② Controlled blood pressure lowering: The blood pressure control goal in the initial stage (within a few minutes to an hour) is to reduce the mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% of the pre-treatment level (pair B), and then control the blood pressure to a higher level within the next 2 to 6 hours. The safe level is generally around 160/100mmHg (C is wrong, the correct answer to this question); if it is tolerated and the clinical condition is stable, it will gradually drop to normal levels in the next 24 to 48 hours; ③ Choose antihypertensive drugs reasonably.

Occasionally, paroxysmal dyspnea occurs at night, and crackles can be heard in both lungs. Consider symptoms of left heart failure. If you have a history of hypertension for 1 year and the maximum blood pressure is 150/90mmHg, you can be diagnosed as grade 1 hypertension. Smoking for 25 years is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The jugular vein is full, the liver is accessible under the ribs, and the lower limbs are edematous (±), which indicates right heart failure. The patient's current diagnosis of total heart failure is clear, and total heart failure caused by coronary heart disease (error C) needs to be considered. Physical examination: P88 beats/min, heart rate 108 beats/min, arrhythmia, varying heart sounds, atrial fibrillation was considered. The heart boundary is enlarged to both sides, which is a manifestation of whole-heart enlargement, and the possibility of dilated cardiomyopathy needs to be considered (B error). A grade 2/6 systolic blow-like murmur heard at the apex is a functional change of the heart, and the patient is accompanied by global heart enlargement, which may be considered as relative mitral valve regurgitation caused by global heart enlargement. When a patient has pericardial effusion, since both the superior and inferior vena cava return flows are blocked, which can cause jugular vein filling and liver subcostal accessibility, the possibility of pericardial effusion needs to be considered (D is wrong). Rheumatic valvular heart disease is more common in mitral valve stenosis accompanied by mitral valve regurgitation and simple mitral valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis is mainly manifested by a low-key rumble-like murmur in the middle and late diastole in the apical area, with a murmur intensity of grade 3/6 or above. , the patient's murmur is only grade 2/6, so rheumatic valvular heart disease can be ruled out first (pair A).",

A physical examination revealed that a grade 3/6 systolic murmur could be heard in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternum. The murmur weakened when squatting. The disease that should be considered first is",

        "Option D": "Dilated cardiomyopathy with cardiac insufficiency",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "This patient has a history of syncope, and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur can be heard in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal edge. The murmur is weakened when squatting, and he is considered to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (pair C). Congenital heart disease with ventricular septal defect (P273) (A error) can hear a loud and rough holosystolic murmur in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternum. The nature of the murmur is similar to that of hypertrophic obstructive heart disease, but it turns left to right when squatting. As the shunt increases, the murmur generally does not weaken or may even increase. In rheumatic heart disease, mitral regurgitation (P292) (B error) can hear a systolic murmur at the apex of the heart, and venous blood returns to the heart when the blood vessels are constricted and squatting or lying down. If the number of mitral valve regurgitation increases, the mitral regurgitation will be relatively more severe, so the murmur will be more obvious. When dilated cardiomyopathy is accompanied by cardiac insufficiency (D error), the heart sounds are weakened by auscultation, and can often be heard as the third or fourth heart sound. When the heart rate is fast, it exhibits a galloping rhythm. Due to the expansion of the cardiac chamber, relative mitral regurgitation can occur, sometimes A systolic murmur can be heard at the apex of the heart (P262).",

        "Explanation": "Acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction is mostly caused by incomplete occlusion of vascular lesions, and intracoronary thrombi are mostly white thrombus formed by platelet aggregation (pair A). In thrombolytic treatment, thrombolytic drugs target fibrin. It is not platelets. If used, the function of the fibrinolytic system will be enhanced. Since the coagulation system and the fibrinolytic system are always in a state of dynamic balance, it will indirectly activate the coagulation system and worsen the condition. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is mostly a red thrombus formed by fibrin cross-linking in the coronary arteries. Early thrombolysis is effective and must be distinguished from non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary artery spasm (C error) is the main cause of variant angina pectoris. Incomplete coronary artery obstruction (False B) and less critical condition (False D) are not the main reasons why thrombolytic therapy should not be used in the treatment of acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.",

Acute myocardial infarction (P236) (False A) mainly manifests as retrosternal squeezing pain. When right ventricular myocardial infarction or right heart failure caused by myocardial infarction, jugular vein distension and dyspnea may occur, but there will be no hyperventilation of blood gases.

        "Explanation": "The compensatory phase of cardiac function in chronic cor pulmonale is mainly characterized by varying degrees of cyanosis and signs of primary pulmonary disease, including signs of emphysema, weakened breath sounds in both lungs, dry and moist rales, and hyperactivity of the second heart sound in the pulmonary valve area (P₂ ˃A₂), systolic murmur in the tricuspid valve area or increased cardiac pulsation under the xiphoid process (pair B) are signs of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. When intrathoracic pressure increases, the vena cava return is obstructed and the jugular vein may be filled or even distended. However, at this time, the cardiac function can still compensate, and there will be no positive hepatojugular reflux sign. When chronic cor pulmonale is decompensated, right heart symptoms such as hepatomegaly and tenderness, positive hepatic jugular reflux sign (A error), diastolic gallop (C error), lower limb edema, and peritoneal effusion signs will appear.

        "Option E": "Restricted expiratory airflow",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The characteristic pathophysiological change of COPD is persistent airflow limitation leading to pulmonary ventilatory dysfunction (E pair). As the disease progresses, the elasticity of the lung tissue decreases day by day, the alveoli continue to expand, and the retraction is blocked, and the residual air volume and the percentage of the residual air volume in the total lung volume increase. At this time, the lungs are overinflated to cause emphysema (P22) (D is wrong); The exacerbation of emphysema leads to a large reduction in the squeeze of capillaries around the alveoli, and the reduction of blood perfusion in the alveolar walls, resulting in an increase in dead space volume, resulting in an imbalance in the proportion of ventilation and blood flow, which together with diffusion disorders lead to dysfunction of ventilatory function (P23 ) (A is wrong); In the end, it will cause hypoxia and carbon dioxide retention. Hypoxia, hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, etc. can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and spasm, and emphysema will compress the alveolar capillaries and cause the capillary bed to collapse. A large amount of mucus is reduced, and eventually the pulmonary circulation resistance increases, and the pulmonary artery pressure increases (P110) (C wrong), which is a characteristic of chronic pulmonary heart disease; mucus hypersecretion refers to inflammation leading to degeneration, necrosis, and shedding of bronchial epithelial cells, and various inflammatory diseases of the bronchial wall. Cell infiltration, hypertrophy and proliferation of goblet cells and mucus glands, vigorous secretion, and large amounts of mucus retained in the airways are common pathological changes and are not a sign of the pathophysiological changes of COPD (wrong B).",

        "Option E": "Bleeding rarely recurs after the first episode",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer. Its incidence accounts for about 20% to 25% of patients with this disease. It is also the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. People with duodenal ulcer are more common with gastric ulcer (A is wrong) ), and those complicated by retrobulbar ulcers are more common. Most of the patients with concurrent bleeding have a history of peptic ulcer within one year. However, after one bleeding, second or more bleeding is likely to occur (False E). There are still 10% to 15% of patients who use heavy bleeding as a digestive ulcer. The first symptom of ulcer. The clinical manifestations of peptic ulcer bleeding depend on the location, speed and amount of bleeding. Generally, melena will appear if 50ml to 100ml of bleeding occurs (pair B); in duodenal ulcer bleeding, melena is more common than vomiting blood, while in gastric ulcer bleeding, melena is more common than vomiting blood.

The symptoms include severe cough, shortness of breath, coughing up a large amount of foamy sputum, moist rales in both lungs, decreased PaO₂, and X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema. Pleural reaction (P118) (False A) refers to dizziness, cold sweat, palpitations, pale complexion, thin pulse, etc. during pleural puncture and fluid extraction; Pneumothorax (P120) (False B) is often sudden chest pain that is sharp and persistent. Stinging or cutting pain, aggravated by inhalation, followed by chest tightness and dyspnea; mediastinal swing (D error) is common in open pneumothorax and multiple rib fractures.",

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are mainly exerted by antagonizing the angiotensin receptor subtype AT₁. The basic characteristics of clinical pharmacology are: the antihypertensive effect of most ARBs increases with increasing doses, and the therapeutic dose window Wider (B is wrong, the correct answer to this question); the antihypertensive effect is slow in onset, but long-lasting and stable (A), and generally reaches the maximum effect in 6 to 8 weeks (C), and the duration of the effect can reach more than 24 hours. (It should be noted that the maximum effect time of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ACEI is 3 to 4 weeks); ARB has very few adverse reactions directly related to the drug (D pair) and will not cause irritating dry cough (ACEI's Typical common adverse reactions), the compliance with continuous treatment is high, but long-term use has the risk of raising blood potassium, and blood potassium levels need to be monitored during the use of the drug.

        "Option D": "Respiratory acidosis combined with metabolic alkalosis",
        "Option E": "Respiratory alkalosis combined with metabolic alkalosis",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "After patients with acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary heart disease use diuretics, potassium ion excretion increases and the body becomes hypokalemic. When potassium is low, the function of the H⁺-K⁺ pump is enhanced, K⁺ enters the outside of the cell, and H⁺ enters the cell, causing alkalosis. At the same time, due to the diuretic effect, the excretion of H⁺ increases, which increases the reabsorption of bicarbonate, and the carbon dioxide in the body increases. The level of hydrogen radicals increases. Because the sum of the main anions in the blood, bicarbonate and chloride ions, is relatively constant, the chloride ions decrease accordingly. Therefore, hypokalemia and hypochloremic alkalosis (metabolic alkalosis) is likely to occur after the use of diuretics. Patients with chronic cor pulmonale have respiratory dysfunction and may experience CO₂ retention, resulting in respiratory acidosis rather than respiratory alkalosis (CE error). Because CO₂ retention develops slowly, the kidneys can maintain a constant pH by reducing the elimination of HCO₃⁻. However, when CO₂ in the body is elevated for a long time, HCO₃⁻ is also maintained at a high level, leading to respiratory acidosis combined with metabolic alkalosis ( D is true), rather than metabolic acidosis (A is wrong). If acute respiratory failure occurs, the kidneys cannot buffer in time, so the acidic substances in the body will increase, resulting in respiratory acidosis combined with metabolic acidosis (B is wrong).",

Autoregulation refers to an adaptive response of tissue cells to environmental stimuli that does not depend on nerve or humoral factors. Many physiological functional activities of the body involve autoregulation: such as myogenic autoregulation (E pair) and tube-glomerular feedback (P230) that regulate renal blood flow, osmotic diuresis and bulb-tubular balance in the process of urine production (P240 ), metabolic autoregulation of local tissues, myogenic autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (P140), heterologous autoregulation of cardiac and skeletal muscles (P91), and a large number of autoregulations in the endocrine system, etc. However, so far only the myogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow (1992N65A, 1999N1A) and the myogenic autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (2012N121B) have been examined. Apnea after hyperventilation occurs because during hyperventilation, pulmonary ventilation increases, exhaled CO₂ increases, PCO₂ in the blood decreases, and the respiratory center is inhibited due to lack of sufficient CO₂ stimulation. It is a chemical receptor-mediated nerve Adjustment (A is wrong). Arterial blood pressure remains relatively constant, mainly related to the baroreceptor reflex of the cardiovascular system, which is a typical neural regulation (B error). Maintaining a relatively constant body temperature depends on skin blood flow, sweating, changes in metabolic levels, etc. under the control of the thermoregulatory center, which is also a typical neuroregulation (C is wrong). The most important factor in maintaining a constant blood sugar level is insulin. The regulation of blood sugar by insulin belongs to humoral regulation (D is wrong).",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When patients with liver cirrhosis develop severe portal hypertension, the highly dynamic circulatory blood flow of the viscera will significantly reduce the systemic blood flow, and because various vasodilator substances cannot be inactivated by the liver, the systemic vascular bed will expand and the cardiac output will be relatively insufficient. And the effective blood volume is insufficient, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system are further activated, eventually leading to strong contraction of renal cortical blood vessels and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, resulting in renal failure, that is, hepatorenal syndrome. In patients with hepatorenal syndrome, the glomerular filtration rate is reduced due to damage to renal function. When the glomerular filtration rate is reduced: ① Nitrogen-containing substances in the body cannot be excreted, and azotemia occurs; ② Renin-vascular tension The hormone-aldosterone system is activated, functional renal failure, renal tubular function is not damaged, urinary sodium reabsorption increases, and urinary sodium content decreases; ③ Due to reduced urine output, water in the body cannot be excreted, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia .

        "Option E": "The risk of intracoronary thrombolysis is greater than that of left ventricular infarction",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Intracoronary thrombolysis recanalizes the occluded coronary arteries and reperfuses the myocardium. Regardless of left ventricular infarction or right ventricular infarction, there is no significant difference in risk during treatment (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). After right ventricular infarction, the right ventricular stroke volume decreases, and the blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of systole increases, resulting in poor blood return in the right atrium and vena cava, causing an increase in central venous pressure; at the same time, due to the decrease in right ventricular stroke volume, pulmonary circulation blood The amount is reduced, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is reduced or normal (pair A). Patients with right heart failure caused by acute myocardial infarction will have relative insufficient filling of the left ventricle due to insufficient right heart ejection. If diuretics are used, they will reduce the filling of the right ventricle and further reduce the filling volume of the left ventricle, so diuretics should be used with caution (D right). On the contrary, increasing the right ventricular end-diastolic volume can help increase the left ventricular blood output and maintain left ventricular function (C pair). Since the right ventricle, inferior wall, and posterior wall are all supplied by the right coronary artery, right ventricular infarction often occurs simultaneously with inferior wall and posterior wall myocardial infarction (pair B).",

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Patients with acute left ventricular dysfunction within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction mainly suffer from necrotic myocardial interstitial congestion and edema, resulting in decreased compliance. The end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle has not yet increased. Digitalis drugs can cause ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, It is advisable to avoid using digitalis preparations within 24 hours after infarction (E is wrong, the correct answer to this question). The application of morphine (pair A) can relieve pain, reduce sympathetic overexcitation and the sense of dying, and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. Rapid diuretics (B pair) can reduce cardiac preload and reduce edema caused by heart failure. Intravenous infusion of dobutamine (pair C) can increase peripheral vascular tone, increase blood pressure, improve renal blood perfusion, and reduce the occurrence of prerenal renal failure. Sodium nitroprusside (P258) (D pair) can reduce cardiac pre- and post-load, reduce PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), increase CI (cardiac index), and at the same time relieve symptoms of cold limbs and cyanosis caused by significant contraction of peripheral blood vessels. .",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The cause of the third heart sound is that at the end of rapid ventricular filling, the ventricular muscle fibers stretch and lengthen, causing sudden tension in the atrioventricular valves, chordae tendineae and papillary muscles, deceleration of blood flow and contact between the ventricle and the chest wall, resulting in vibration (error B). In normal people, especially in adolescents and children, there may be a third heart sound at the apex of the heart, which changes with breathing and disappears when sitting. It is more common when exercise, fever, increased heart rate, and raising of legs, etc., accelerate ventricular diastolic filling. Obviously, this situation may have no pathological significance. At the same time, the third heart sound may also occur in the case of high cardiac output. In early diastole, blood fills the enlarged ventricle very quickly, causing vibration of the ventricular wall and impacting the surrounding tissue and chest wall, or may vibrate the atrioventricular valve to produce sound. .

The indicators for judging active bleeding in the digestive tract include: ① Repeated vomiting of blood or increased frequency of melena, thin feces, and active bowel sounds (D pair); ② The peripheral circulation status has not been significantly improved after adequate fluid rehydration and blood transfusion, or it has been temporary. It gets better and then continues to worsen; ③ The hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, and hematocrit continue to decrease, and the reticulocyte count continues to increase; ④ When fluid replenishment and urine output are sufficient, blood urea nitrogen continues to increase or increases again (P451). A dull complexion (wrong A) is the appearance of liver disease in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and does not indicate active bleeding. Mild jaundice of the sclera (B error) is a manifestation of jaundice in the decompensated stage of liver cirrhosis and cannot indicate active bleeding. Positive moving dullness (C error) is a manifestation of ascites in the decompensated stage of cirrhosis and does not indicate active bleeding.",

        "Explanation": "Chronic glomerulonephritis can cause renal parenchymal hypertension, which usually requires combined treatment with antihypertensive drugs (pair A) to control blood pressure below 130/80mmHg. The treatment goals for chronic nephritis and hypertension: when urine protein ≥1g/d, blood pressure should be controlled below 125/75mmHg (B is wrong); when urine protein is ≤1g/d, blood pressure control can be relaxed to below 130/80mmHg (C is wrong) . ACEI drugs have the effect of dilating glomerular arteries, but dilation of efferent arterioles is stronger than dilation of afferent arterioles, resulting in a decrease in glomerular effective filtration pressure, further decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and worsening of renal function. . In addition, patients with renal insufficiency have high blood potassium, and ACEI drugs have a potassium-sparing effect, which will further increase serum potassium after use. Severe hyperkalemia can easily cause cardiac electrophysiological disorders, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. .

        "Explanation": "Aortic valve stenosis generally does not cause thrombosis, so there are few complications of embolism (A is wrong, the correct answer to this question). Aortic valve stenosis leads to a significant increase in left ventricular systolic pressure and compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to ventricular wall stiffness and reduced compliance during diastole. Left atrial enlargement and left atrial pressure increase may subsequently occur, ultimately leading to left ventricular dysfunction. Incomplete (pair D). Left ventricular hypertrophy causes an increase in myocardial oxygen demand, and an increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure further reduces coronary blood flow, leading to myocardial ischemia and angina (pair B).

        "Option E": "Symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy may be related to cerebral edema",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When a patient develops malignant hypertension, the diastolic blood pressure persists ≥130mmHg, and renal damage is prominent, manifested by persistent proteinuria, hematuria, and cast urine. Therefore, renal complications are the most prominent in malignant hypertension, not the brain (C is incorrect, which is the correct answer to this question) ). The organs mainly affected by hypertension are the heart, brain, and kidneys (pair A). Fundus arterioles are the only arterioles that can be observed from the body surface. Observation of fundus vascular lesions can help understand hypertensive vascular lesions and help determine the severity of hypertension (pair B). Long-term hypertension causes ischemia and degeneration of cerebral blood vessels, forming microaneurysms. Once ruptured, cerebral hemorrhage may occur. Clinically relevant data show that the incidence of stroke is about 5 times higher than that of myocardial infarction (D pair). One of the pathogenesis mechanisms of hypertensive encephalopathy is that high blood pressure increases cerebral vascular perfusion, capillary pressure is too high, and permeability is enhanced, leading to cerebral edema (E pair).",

It can also act on vagus nerve afferent fibers, increase the sensitivity of cardiac baroreceptors, delay atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation, thereby reducing The ventricular rate of atrial fibrillation is slow and does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption, so digitalis is most suitable for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with a rapid ventricular rate (pair C). Digitalis poisoning may occur if digitalis is used within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction (A is wrong) and should be used with caution. Patients with hyperthyroid cardiomyopathy are mainly treated for hyperthyroidism. After the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are relieved, the symptoms of heart disease can be improved (False B).

It is generally believed to be caused by the alternation of strong and weak left ventricular contractility and is one of the important signs of left ventricular heart failure. Pulsus paradoxus (B error), also known as apnea pulse, is characterized by the pulse weakening or even disappearing during inhalation, and reappearing or returning to its original state during exhalation. It can be seen in large amounts of pericardial effusion, constrictive pericarditis, and emphysema. and bronchial asthma.

        "Option E": "Slow down the heart rate and reduce the work done by the myocardium",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The main mechanisms of calcium channel blockers in treating angina pectoris include: ① Blocking L-type calcium channels on the myocardial cell membrane, reducing the amount of calcium ions entering the myocardial cells, thereby inhibiting the utilization of calcium ions in the excitation-contraction coupling of myocardial cells, and inhibiting myocardial infarction. Contraction, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption (A pair); ② dilating coronary arteries, relieving coronary artery spasm, and improving myocardial oxygen supply (D pair); ③ dilating peripheral arteries, lowering blood pressure, and reducing afterload (B pair); ④ also reducing Blood viscosity, anti-platelet aggregation (C pair), improve myocardial microcirculation. Calcium antagonists include dihydropyridines (nifedipine, amlodipine, nicardipine, etc.) and non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil, etc.). Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have a strong inhibitory effect on myocardium and have negative frequency, negative muscle strength and negative conduction effects. They can slow down the heart rate and reduce myocardial work; while dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (such as nitrate Bendipine) has strong dilation effect on peripheral blood vessels and obvious antihypertensive effect. It can reflexively excite sympathetic nerves and cause the heart rate to increase (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "CPK (creatine phosphokinase) and CK (creatine kinase) are the same substance. CK is widely present in various tissues and is mainly related to the regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The function of this enzyme is to maintain intracellular function at a physiological level. adenosine triphosphate concentration. CK is composed of two subunits, M and B, which are combined into three isoenzymes: CK-BB (CK₁), CK-MB (CK₂), and CK-MM (CK₃). CK-BB is mostly found in the brain, and CK- MB is most abundant in myocardium, and CK-MM accounts for 90% in skeletal muscle. Therefore, elevated CK-MB has good specificity for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important enzyme in the energy metabolism process in the body. This enzyme exists in almost all tissues, and its distribution characteristics are that LDH₁ is the main enzyme in the heart and kidney, followed by LDH₂; LDH₃ and LDH₄ are the main enzymes in the lungs; LDH₅ is the main enzyme in skeletal muscle; LDH₅ is the main enzyme in the liver, followed by LDH₄. The activity of LDH in these tissues is much higher than that in serum. Therefore, when a small amount of tissue dies, the enzyme is released into the blood and increases the activity in other blood. Determination of this enzyme is often used to assist in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and certain malignant tumors. To sum up, the options with the highest specificity for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction are CPK-MB (CK-MB) and LDH₁ (C pair).",

        "Explanation": "middle-aged woman with fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, and anorexia for 2 months (common clinical manifestations of anemia). Blood routine showed Hb72g/L (normal adult women 110~150g/L), MCV124fl (normal value 80~100fl), MCH40pg (normal value 27~34pg), MCHC330g/L (normal value 320~360g/L) (MCV and MCH are both increased, MCHC is normal, consistent with laboratory examination of megaloblastic anemia), Ret1.0% (percentage of normal value 0.005 ~0.015), WBC3.4×10⁹/L (normal value 4~10×10⁹/L), Plt85×10⁹/L (normal value 100~300×10⁹/L). Based on the patient's clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, the possible diagnosis is megaloblastic anemia. Patients with megaloblastic anemia may develop beef-like tongue due to atrophy of the oral mucosa and tongue papilla (pair A). Spatulate nails (B error) are more common in iron deficiency anemia, manifesting as microcytic hypochromic anemia. Skin ecchymosis (C error) is more common in aplastic anemia.

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Before surgical resection of pheochromocytoma, α-receptor antagonists need to be used to lower blood pressure, reduce the burden on the heart, and increase the originally reduced vascular volume. Prazosin (A error), phentolamine (C error), and phentolamine (E error) are all α-blockers and can be used alone. Sodium nitroprusside (wrong D) is a dilator of peripheral small arteries and veins. For patients with sudden increase in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside can be used alone for intravenous infusion. Preoperative beta-blockers do not need to be used routinely. If the patient has tachycardia or arrhythmia, beta-blockers need to be used. Before using beta-blockers, alpha-blockers must be used to lower blood pressure. If beta-blockers are used alone, blood pressure will rise due to blocking the vasodilating effect mediated by beta-receptors. High, pulmonary edema may even occur, so beta-blockers such as atenolol cannot be used alone (pair B).",

        "Option E": "The murmurs caused by rheumatic heart disease are mainly early and mid-systolic.",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "When the mitral valve is insufficient, the greater the regurgitation volume at the valve orifice, the higher the pitch of the murmur (Pair A); the thicker the valve, the rougher the murmur (Pair B). When mitral valve insufficiency occurs, the anterior leaflet is damaged and the murmur is mainly conducted to the left axilla or left subscapula (pair C). When the posterior leaflet is damaged, the murmur is mainly conducted to the bottom of the heart. In mitral regurgitation, due to the shortened left ventricular ejection period, the aortic valve closes prematurely, and S₂ is usually split during auscultation (D error). Reverse cleavage means that the aortic valve closes later than the pulmonary valve. Abnormal S₂ cleavage (reverse cleavage) is a pathological sign and is seen in complete left bundle branch block, aortic stenosis, and severe hypertension. The typical murmur of mitral regurgitation is a holosystolic blowing murmur in the apical region (E is wrong, the correct answer to this question), and the murmur intensity is ≥ level 3/6.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The generation of the fourth heart sound is related to the sudden tension and vibration of the atrioventricular valves and their related structures (valve, valve annulus, chordae tendineae and papillary muscles) caused by atrial contraction, also called atrial sound (9th edition of Diagnostics P149). During atrial fibrillation, the atrium loses its normal systolic function and the fourth heart sound does not occur (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). There are three typical cardiac auscultation manifestations of atrial fibrillation: heart sounds of varying intensity (Pair A), absolutely irregular heart rhythm (Pair B), and short pulse (that is, the heart rate is greater than the pulse rate) (Pair D).

        "Option D": "dopamine",
        "Option E": "Metahydroxylamine",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When used in small doses, dopamine mainly acts on dopamine receptors, dilating renal and mesenteric blood vessels, increasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, increasing urine output and sodium excretion; small to medium doses can directly stimulate β₁ receptors. The body and indirectly promote the release of norepinephrine from the storage site, which has a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium, increases myocardial contractility and stroke volume, improves coronary blood flow and oxygen consumption; in large doses, it stimulates α-receptors, leading to Peripheral vascular resistance increases, renal vasoconstriction, and renal blood flow and urine output decrease. Therefore, dopamine (pair D) constricts the arterioles of the skin and muscles and dilates the arterioles of the kidneys and internal organs. Sodium nitroprusside (P258) (A wrong) has a direct dilation effect on both arterial and venous smooth muscles. Vasodilation reduces the preload and afterload of the heart and improves cardiac output, so it is beneficial to heart failure. Phentolamine (B) is an α-receptor blocker that dilates small arteries in the skin and muscles and is used for vasospastic diseases. Isoproterenol (C) is a β-receptor agonist. It has a strong agonistic effect on both β₁ and β₂ receptors, but has little effect on α-receptors. It mainly acts on β₂ receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing skeletal muscle blood vessels to significantly relax. It has a weaker effect on renal and mesenteric blood vessels. It also has a relaxing effect on coronary blood vessels and increases tissue blood flow. The main function of metahydroxylamine (E-hydroxylamine) is to directly stimulate α-receptors and constrict blood vessels. Its pressor effect is weaker and longer-lasting than that of norepinephrine.",

According to the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and signs, the most likely diagnosis is mitral stenosis. The patient now has sudden palpitations and a physical examination of P85 times/min ( Pulse rate is less than heart rate), blood pressure is 110/70mmHg, heart rate is 102 beats/min (heart rate is accelerated, pulse rate is less than heart rate), and arrhythmia. At this time, the patient should be complicated by atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can reduce cardiac output and induce or aggravate cardiac stress. Failure changes the intensity of the heart murmur, so the patient's murmur may now change to a typical late diastolic murmur that weakens or disappears (pair C). The mechanism is that when mitral valve stenosis occurs, a diastolic rumble-like murmur can be heard at the apex of the heart, which can be enhanced before systole. The location of the murmur is often limited and is easier to hear when lying on the left side. This murmur has a low to medium pitch, starts immediately after the valve opening sound, and is progressive. Depending on the pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle during ventricular diastole and the blood flow conditions, the murmur can occupy mid- or late diastole. In late diastole, the atrium contracts, the above-mentioned pressure difference increases, and the remaining blood in the left atrium is discharged into the left ventricle quickly. A high-pitched murmur may appear, reaching its peak before the first heart sound, which is presystolic enhancement. Or a presystolic murmur (the fourth heart sound). When atrial fibrillation occurs, the atrium cannot expel the remaining blood quickly. At this time, the presystolic murmur disappears, that is, the late diastolic murmur weakens or disappears. The above can be easily understood as: the diastolic murmur in mitral stenosis is produced when blood flows through the mitral valve during ventricular diastole. In atrial fibrillation, in late diastole (atrial systole), the atrium is unable to move blood rapidly Emitted into the ventricle, so the murmur weakens or disappears at this time.",

        "Option E": "Renal artery embolism, severe pain in the kidney area",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Percussion pain in the kidney area refers to the angle between the lateral edge of the erector spinae muscle and the 12th rib. Percussion pain often indicates inflammation of the kidneys, including perirenal tissues, renal tuberculosis, kidney stones or tumors. With hydronephrosis, as long as there is no infection, the patient may have no symptoms and no pain in the kidney area during the interval between attacks (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The onset of interstitial nephritis is related to factors such as infection, autoimmunity, drugs, and metabolism. Interstitial nephritis caused by drugs often manifests as oliguric or non-oliguric acute kidney injury, and some may be accompanied by renal area tenderness ( Second edition of the eight-year internal medicine program P627) (Pair A). The typical clinical manifestations of patients with IgA nephropathy are asymptomatic hematuria, and tenderness in the renal area may occur when the kidney swelling stretches the renal capsule and extrarenal small vessels (pair B). In addition to fever, tachycardia, and general muscle tenderness, pyelonephritis can also reveal costovertebral angle or ureteral point tenderness on one or both sides and/or percussion pain in the renal area (D pair). Renal artery embolism (E pair) can cause severe low back pain on the affected side, percussion pain at the costovertebral angle (renal area), proteinuria, and hematuria.",

        "Explanation": "The patient had a pear-shaped heart shadow and a diastolic rumbling murmur in the apex area. The patient was initially diagnosed as rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis. An elevated second sound in the pulmonary valve indicates pulmonary hypertension and should be intervened as soon as possible. Valve opening sounds can be heard in the apical area, indicating that the valve function is still good. At this time, percutaneous mitral valve separation (C pair) should be used.

Mitral valve replacement (D error) is suitable for patients with severe stenosis who are not suitable for valvotomy and balloon dilatation. Its postoperative complications and mortality are higher than those of separation surgery. The inotropic drug digitalis (A) is not helpful in improving cardiac function, and may even aggravate pulmonary edema and dyspnea by enhancing the contractility of the right heart.

        "Explanation": "Glucocorticoids (GC), mainly cortisol, can increase the number of red blood cells, platelets, and neutrophils in the blood, while decreasing the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The main effect of cortisol on adipose tissue is to increase lipase activity in the limbs, promote lipolysis, and inhibit fat synthesis (pair A). However, hyperglycemia caused by cortisol can secondaryly cause increased insulin secretion, and increased insulin can enhance fat synthesis. , increasing fat deposition in the trunk, causing central obesity, moon face, and buffalo back. Cortisol can promote protein catabolism and inhibit anabolism (B pair), resulting in a negative protein balance. Increased cortisol activates the renin-angiotensin system, resulting in increased plasma renin (pair D). Increased cortisol can negatively feedback inhibit the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins (E pair), reducing sex hormone levels, causing reduced, irregular or amenorrhea in women, and loss of sexual desire in men.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "small number of patients develop the condition rapidly, with persistent diastolic blood pressure ≥130mmHg, headache, blurred vision, fundus hemorrhage, exudation, optic disc edema, prominent kidney damage, persistent proteinuria, hematuria and cast urine, which is called malignant hypertension (rapid progressive type). Hypertension) (P257). Rapidly progressive hypertension (D pair) is often accompanied by acute left ventricular failure. This is due to the increase in left ventricular afterload and the inability of myocardial contractility to increase accordingly, resulting in a decrease in left heart ejection volume and inability to meet the metabolic needs of the body's tissues. Pulmonary infarction (error A) and pulmonary valve stenosis (error C) lead to increased right ventricular ejection resistance and increased afterload, leading to right heart failure. Ventricular septal defect (B error) and aortic sinus aneurysm rupture into the right ventricle (E error) all lead to an increase in pulmonary circulation blood volume, an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, a functional increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in the early stage, and histological changes in the pulmonary blood vessels in the late stage, leading to severe Pulmonary hypertension and eventually right heart failure.",

        "Option E": "Improper treatment can cause pericardial constriction",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Pericardial friction rub is produced by the friction between the rough pericardial wall layer and the visceral layer during heart activity. It is common in the early stage of fibrinous pericarditis when the amount of fluid effusion is small. The amount of pericardial effusion in tuberculous pericarditis is generally large (right A). At this time, the visceral parietal pericardium is separated and the pericardial friction sound disappears (wrong C, which is the correct answer to this question). The pericardial effusion in tuberculous pericarditis may be serous, fibrinous or bloody (pair B). Tuberculous pericarditis can spread from mediastinal, pulmonary, and pleural tuberculosis or transfer to the pericardium via lymph nodes, so there may be no tuberculosis lesions in the lungs (D pair). If not properly treated, it can turn into a subacute or chronic phase, during which the effusion is gradually absorbed, fibrous tissue proliferates, the pericardium thickens and becomes adhesions, and some develop into pericardial coarctation (E pair).",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Jugular venous distension (D is wrong, is the correct answer to this question) or not can reflect changes in right atrial pressure and volume. When a normal person is standing or sitting, the external jugular vein is not exposed. It is slightly filled when in the supine position, but it is limited to 2/3 of the distance from the upper edge of the clavicle to the angle of the mandible. If it exceeds the above level or is 45° in the semi-recumbent position, Jugular vein filling, distension, and fullness are called jugular venous distention, indicating increased venous pressure, indicating right heart dysfunction and systemic circulation congestion. Gallop rhythm refers to a three-note heart rhythm in which extra heart sounds occur during diastole. Due to the concurrent increase in heart rate, the extra heart sounds and the original S₁ and S₂ form a sound similar to the sound of hoofbeats when a horse is galloping. Gallop rhythm is a sign of severe damage to the myocardium. The appearance of early diastolic gallop (A pair) indicates severe organic heart disease, which is common in heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, severe myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. The alternating pulse (B pair) is a pulse with a regular rhythm and alternating strength and weakness. It is generally believed to be caused by the alternation of strong and weak left ventricular contractility and is one of the important signs of left ventricular heart failure. Commonly seen in heart failure caused by hypertensive heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, and aortic regurgitation. Different degrees of dyspnea may occur in left heart failure (pair C). The earliest symptom of left heart failure is exertional dyspnea, and in severe cases, it manifests as orthopnea (pair E).",

        "Question": "Regarding premature atrioventricular junctional contractions, which of the following is correct?",
        "Option A": "Clinically more common",
        "Option B": "Often occurs in the absence of structural heart disease",
        "Option C": "Occasionally, covert conduction can occur",
        "Option D": "Its origin is in the atrioventricular node itself",
        "Option E": "Generally, most of the descending ventricles are accompanied by conduction block",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Atrioventricular junctional premature contractions are clinically uncommon (A is wrong), but ventricular premature contractions are more common. Junctional premature beats can be seen in both normal healthy people and patients with organic heart disease (B error). Junctional premature beats are premature heart beats that occur under special circumstances, and the impulse that causes this beat originates from the atrioventricular junction area (D error), which includes the atrioventricular node and His bundle. Silent atrioventricular junctional premature contractions refer to premature contractions in the junctional zone. Although accompanied by bidirectional conduction block, they can neither forwardly conduct to excite the ventricles nor retrogradely conduct to excite the atria. However, this concealed conduction is not possible due to the Excited part of the atrioventricular junction tissue creates a new refractory period, which can affect the conduction of the next sinus beat, thereby causing a variety of arrhythmias. Therefore, premature atrioventricular junctional contractions can occasionally be occultly conducted (pair C). Atrioventricular junctional premature beats generally have no conduction block (E error) and the QRS wave shape is normal. However, when the premature beat phase is too early, intraventricular differential conduction block may occur, and the QRS wave appears wide and deformed.",

        "Option E": "Does not invade the meninges",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Acute patients are more likely to have changes in the nature and intensity of heart murmurs than subacute patients (D pair), which are mostly caused by vegetation rupture, valve rupture, and chordae tendineae rupture. Subacute infective endocarditis (P308) often occurs on the basis of heart diseases such as rheumatic valvular heart disease, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. This disease tends to occur in young and middle-aged patients (False A). Cardiac vegetations are mostly attached to the affected valves (error B), and are common on the atrial surface of the valve with mitral regurgitation, the ventricular surface of the valve with aortic regurgitation, and the right ventricular side of the ventricular septal defect, and rarely on the right atrial appendage. The negative blood culture rate is 2.5% to 64%, so a negative blood culture does not rule out the disease (False C). The shedding of vegetations containing bacteria can cause cerebral embolism, which can lead to brain abscess and purulent meningitis (False E).",

        "Explanation": "An elderly male patient has been coughing and producing sputum repeatedly for more than 10 years. He has been short of breath after activity for 1 year (coughing phlegm and wheezing for many years, suggesting COPD). One week ago, his shortness of breath worsened after catching a cold, and he coughed up yellow sputum, accompanied by fever, with a maximum body temperature of 39°C (suggesting COPD). Infection, acute exacerbation period), can lie down at night, smoked for 30 years (cause of COPD), physical examination: T38.2℃ (normal value: 36.0~37.0℃, fever), P96 times/min (normal value: 60~ 100 times/min), R23 times/min (normal value: 12~20 times/min), BP150/80mmHg (normal blood pressure is 90~139mmHg/60~89mmHg, high blood pressure), conscious, bulbar conjunctival edema, Cyanosis of the lips (sign of hypoxia), barrel chest (sign of emphysema). Auscultation showed low breath sounds in both lungs, and scattered crackles could be heard (suggesting pulmonary inflammation). Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation showed pH 7.31 (normal value 7.35-7.45, acidosis), PaCO₂: 78mmHg (normal: 35 ~45mmHg, >50mmHg, with CO₂retention), PaO₂: 52mmHg (normal: 90~100mmHg, <60mmHg, indicating respiratory failure). Based on the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and signs, and laboratory test results, the most likely diagnosis is 1 .Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute exacerbation period; 2. Type II respiratory failure. The patient developed drowsiness and confusion (changes in consciousness) after treatment. Arterial blood gas analysis was reviewed (oxygen inhalation 2L/min, oxygen concentration 29%), pH 7.24 (aggravated acidosis), PaCO₂: 85mmHg (CO₂ retention aggravated) ), PaO₂: 62mmHg (oxygenation is not ideal). The above situation shows that after treatment, the patient’s respiratory failure worsens, and more serious acid-base balance disorders, hypoxemia and mental changes occur. In order to improve the patient’s condition, it is appropriate to perform Tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (A is true and BC is false). Indications for invasive mechanical ventilation in the acute exacerbation of COPD include: 1. Severe dyspnea, accessory respiratory muscles are involved in breathing, and chest and abdominal contradictions; 2. Respiratory frequency >35 times/min; 3. Life-threatening hypothermia Oxygenemia, PaO₂＜40mmHg or PaO₂/FiO₂＜200mmHg; 4. Severe respiratory acidosis (pH＜7.25) and hypercapnia; 5. Respiratory depression or cessation; 6.

Other complications (metabolic disorders, sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, barotrauma, massive pleural effusion); 9. NPPV failure or There are contraindications to NPPV (Practical Internal Medicine, 16th edition, P1090). Increasing the oxygen flow rate to 5L/min (D is wrong) means that the inspired oxygen concentration is 41% (the low-flow oxygen concentration is 28% to 30%), which will cause CO₂ retention due to excessively high inspired oxygen concentration.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "patient with acute pancreatitis (pancreatitis is a common risk factor for ARDS) developed progressively worsening dyspnea 3 days later (characteristics of the course of ARDS), T37.5°C (normal body temperature 36-37°C, low fever), P110 times/min ( The normal heart rate for adults is 60 to 100 beats/min, and the heart rate is accelerated), R32 beats/min (>20 beats/min, and the respiratory rate is accelerated), BP130/80mmHg (normal blood pressure), cyanosis of the lips (hypoxemia), double There are a few crackles in the lungs (visible signs of ARDS), and the chest X-ray shows multiple patchy shadows in both lungs (imaging manifestations of ARDS). Based on the patient's medical history, course characteristics, clinical manifestations and signs, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is respiratory distress syndrome. Symptoms (ARDS), the main treatment measures for ARDS include: active oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, treatment of the primary disease and adjustment of fluid balance, etc. After diagnosis, the first choice treatment is to improve gas exchange, including oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation (pair A), Mechanical ventilation is an important measure in the treatment of ARDS. The key to mechanical ventilation is to recruit collapsed alveoli and keep them open to increase lung volume and improve oxygenation, while avoiding damage caused by overexpansion and repeated opening and closing of alveoli. , currently recommended lung protective ventilation strategies, the main measures include appropriate levels of PEEP and small tidal volumes. ARDS is easily complicated by infection, which is also a common cause of ARDS. Therefore, anti-infective treatment (wrong C) is the conventional treatment for ARDS, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used for treatment. Bronchoscope suctioning (False D) can prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. In order to reduce pulmonary edema, the amount of fluid inflow should be reasonably limited, maintain effective circulation with a lower permissible circulation volume, keep the lungs in a relatively \"dry\" state, and maintain a stable blood pressure and ensure organ and tissue perfusion. A mild negative balance is appropriate, and diuretics can be used to promote the resolution of edema; the therapeutic value of cardiotonic drugs such as β-agonists in ARDS is not yet clear (B is wrong).",

It refers to a contraction that occurs in advance after the effective refractory period of the ventricular muscle and before the arrival of the next sinoatrial node excitement. The ventricle is stimulated by an external stimulus and occurs in advance. Premature contraction has its own effective refractory period. When a sinoatrial node excitation immediately after the premarch excitation is conducted to the ventricle, if it happens to fall within the effective refractory period of the premarch excitation (E pair), then This normally transmitted sinus node excitement will not be able to cause ventricular excitation and contraction, that is, there will be a \"loss\" of excitement and contraction, and it will have to wait until the next sinus node excitement is transmitted to cause excitement and contraction.

        "Option D": "acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "An elderly male patient has experienced dull pain in the precordium area when running quickly for the past year, which lasts for 3 to 5 minutes and can be relieved after resting. Based on the clinical manifestations, the most likely diagnosis is stable angina pectoris; in the past month, the trigger threshold for chest pain has decreased, The duration is prolonged, the attack is accompanied by sweating, and the attack occurs again a day ago, which can be relieved after oral administration of nitroglycerin. ST-T changes can be seen on the electrocardiogram during chest pain attacks, that is, on the basis of relatively stable exertional angina, the angina pectoris gradually intensifies and the pain becomes more severe. Severe, longer or more frequent. According to the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and electrocardiogram results, the patient's coronary heart disease is classified as unstable angina (UA) (B is correct and A is incorrect), and the category is worsening angina. The clinical manifestations of UA and NSTEMI generally have one of the following three characteristics: ① Angina pectoris occurs at rest or at night, often lasting more than 20 minutes; ② Recent angina pectoris (within 2 months duration) and severe degree; ③ Recent angina pectoris Gradual worsening (including frequency, duration, severity of attacks) and pain radiating to new areas. During an attack, there may be symptoms such as sweating, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, or difficulty breathing; and the original measures to relieve angina become ineffective or not completely effective at this time. Symptoms may be atypical in the elderly, women, and diabetic patients. In non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (C error), most of the ECG leads have persistent ST-segment depression (that is, no ST-segment elevation) or are accompanied by symmetrical T-wave inversion and progressive R-wave depression in the corresponding leads. And the diagnosis is prompted when the ECG changes last for more than 12 hours. The clinical manifestations of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (D error) are more severe squeezing or suffocating chest pain, with less frequent triggers, longer attacks, ranging from several hours to 1 to 2 days, and nitroglycerin is less effective. or invalid, the electrocardiogram has obvious characteristic and dynamic changes, and serum myocardial necrosis markers are helpful for identification.",

According to the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and signs, the patient's current main diagnosis is dilated cardiomyopathy (C pair). Valvular heart disease (A error) is a heart disease caused by heart valve stenosis or/and insufficiency caused by a variety of reasons. Rheumatic heart disease is the most common. Echocardiography can help to identify and evaluate the location of the disease. Lesion severity (P285). The clinical diagnostic criteria for essential hypertension (B error) are office systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg without the use of antihypertensive drugs (P250). Coronary heart disease (CHD) (wrong D) is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. When coronary blood flow cannot meet the needs of myocardial metabolism, it causes myocardial ischemia and hypoxia.

She had another attack half an hour ago and came to the hospital. She has been consciously losing weight and feeling weak in the past six months. , sweating, good appetite, poor sleep, elevated blood pressure (clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism), physical examination: T37.2°C (increased basal body temperature), P90 times/min, BP140/70mmHg (increased blood pressure), skin Sweating, no vascular murmur in the neck, normal lungs, small heart boundary, irregular heartbeat, hand tremor (±) (hyperthyroidism may have signs of hyperdynamic circulation). The electrocardiogram showed: the ventricular rate was 136 beats/min, the P wave disappeared, and f waves of varying shapes were visible. The QRS wave duration was 0.08\" and varied in interval (atrial fibrillation electrocardiogram manifestation). According to the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, signs and imaging examinations As a result, the most likely diagnosis is hyperthyroidism. The concurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at this time belongs to thyrotoxic heart disease. Patients with hyperthyroidism often develop arrhythmias regardless of whether they have heart disease or not, often with atrial fibrillation. Systolic and atrial fibrillation are common, paroxysmal or persistent. Most electrocardiograms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (A error) show a rapid heart rate with normal QRS wave complex shape and regular RR intervals. Frequent atrial fibrillation Premature contractions (B error) often occur in patients with various structural heart diseases. The main manifestations are palpitations. Some patients have chest tightness and fatigue symptoms. Some patients may not have any symptoms. The electrocardiogram is characterized by P wave occurring in advance, and the shape is similar to that of P wave. The sinus P wave is different, the PR interval is >120 milliseconds, the QRS wave pattern is supraventricular, and some may have intraventricular differential conduction, mostly incomplete compensatory intervals. Paroxysmal atrial flutter (D error) is more common in organic matter In patients with chronic heart disease, symptoms are positively correlated with the speed of the ventricular rate. Atrial flutter is accompanied by a faster ventricular rate, which can induce angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram is characterized by the disappearance of the sinus P wave, the appearance of F waves, and the presence of flutter waves. The wires disappear, the frequency is usually 250 to 350 beats/min, the ventricular rate is regular or not depends on whether the atrioventricular conduction ratio is constant, the QRS wave shape is normal, there is intraventricular differential conduction, original bundle branch block or paraventricular conduction When passing down the road, the QRS wave becomes wider and has an abnormal shape.",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Cardiac neurosis (Pair A) is a neurosis whose main manifestation is heart discomfort. This disease is more common in women, especially menopausal women. Mental and psychological factors are closely related to the onset of this disease, among which \"psychological suggestion\" plays a particularly important role. Prominent, palpitations, precordial pain, shortness of breath or hyperventilation are common. Nervous system symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and even nervousness, dizziness, sweaty palms, fatigue, and trembling hands are common. Cardiovascular physical examinations are mostly normal, and auscultation can Enhanced heart sounds or mild systolic murmur in the precordial area are heard. A few patients may have sinus tachycardia or ST segment changes on the ECG. The latter mostly manifests as non-specific ST segment J-point depression or horizontal downward movement, and (or ) T wave is flat, bidirectional or inverted. ST-T changes are mainly limited to leads II, III, aVF or V₄~V₆ (15th edition of Practical Internal Medicine P1119-P1120). Unstable angina (pair C) belongs to acute coronary syndrome, which is a group of clinical syndromes caused by myocardial ischemia. Unstable angina can have typical angina symptoms, as well as new related symptoms such as sweating, nausea, palpitations or dyspnea during the attack, and typical ischemic electrocardiographic changes (new or transient ST segment depression ≥0.1 mV, or T wave is flat or inverted) and markers of myocardial injury, signs may include a transient systolic murmur. Pulmonary embolism (D pair) is a general term for a group of diseases or clinical syndromes caused by obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by various emboli. The most common is pulmonary thromboembolism. The symptoms are diverse and lack specificity. They can range from Symptoms can range from hemodynamic instability to sudden death. The typical \"triad\" of pulmonary embolism is dyspnea, chest pain and hemoptysis, but clinically only less than 30% of patients experience it. At the same time, pulmonary embolism generally has high-risk factors. For example, long-term bed rest, postoperative surgery, etc., the most common clinical manifestation is dyspnea, and the degree is related to the scope of embolism, followed by chest pain, mostly pleuritic chest pain. The symptoms, signs, and electrocardiogram examination of this patient cannot completely rule out pulmonary embolism. Based on the patient's personal history, past medical history, clinical manifestations, physical signs, and electrocardiogram results, the above diseases cannot be ruled out, and detailed identification and diagnosis are required. Signs of acute myocardial infarction include fatigue, chest discomfort, palpitations during activity, shortness of breath, irritability, etc. Symptoms of angina pectoris during the attack (more severe in nature, longer in duration, and less effective with nitroglycerin) are often accompanied by irritability, sweating, fear or A sense of impending death, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, arrhythmia, hypotension, shock, etc. In severe cases, heart failure (mainly left heart failure) may occur, and a rough systolic murmur may appear in the apex area. The characteristic electrocardiogram changes are as follows ST-segment arch-like elevation, pathological Q wave, and T wave inversion (P229-P245). This patient can walk to the hospital for medical treatment after symptoms appear. The clinical manifestations and signs cannot be completely explained by acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, according to the current According to the data, the patient's least likely disease is acute myocardial infarction (B is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

Physical examination showed the disappearance of abdominal breathing and peritoneal irritation, and the disappearance of bowel sounds and liver dullness. The diagnosis was considered to be perforation of ulcer (pair B). The patient ate a lot at dinner, which was a predisposing factor for the ulcer perforation; the sudden cutting pain quickly spread to the entire abdomen, which was caused by the flow of gastric contents into the abdominal cavity after the perforation, causing strong peritonitis; extensive peritonitis made the entire abdominal muscles highly tense and tonic, and the abdomen Breathing is forced to stop, the abdomen is plate-like and rigid, and gas enters the peritoneal cavity, making it impossible to tap the location of the liver dullness boundary. Diffuse peritonitis can cause paralytic intestinal obstruction and bowel sounds disappear. Perforated appendicitis (wrong A) typically manifests as metastatic right lower abdominal pain, and due to the wrapping of the greater omentum, peritonitis is difficult to spread to the entire abdomen.

Among them, the working cells (ventricular myocardium and atrial myocardium) have excitability, conductivity and contractility, and the autonomous cells (sinoatrial node cells, atrioventricular node cells, Purkinje cells) have excitability, autonomicity and conductivity. Among all myocardial cells, sinoatrial node cells have the highest automaticity and the slowest conduction rate in the atrioventricular junction area: sinoatrial node cells have the fastest automatic depolarization rate in phase 4 action potential and the highest number of excitations per unit time. Therefore, The highest self-discipline (E pair); the cell diameter in the atrioventricular junction area is the smallest, the longitudinal resistance of the local current flowing along the longitudinal axis of the cell is the largest, the spread distance of the electrotonic potential is the shortest, and therefore the conduction speed of excitement is the slowest.",

        "Explanation": "The staging criteria for the depth of general (ether) anesthesia can be divided into four stages. (1) Phase I (analgesic period) refers to the period from the beginning of anesthesia induction to the patient’s loss of consciousness. At this time, the cerebral cortex is gradually inhibited, consciousness is gradually lost, pain is reduced, breathing and heart rate are slightly accelerated, and other reflexes still exist. Surgery is not suitable at this stage; (2) Stage II (excited stage) (A is wrong) means that the cerebral cortex is inhibited, the subcortical center loses control, and the clinical manifestations are excited state, such as respiratory disorders, blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations. Eventually deep, rhythmic breathing occurs. No surgery is allowed during this period; (3) Stage III (surgical anesthesia period) means that the subcortical center is suppressed, excitement disappears, and pain sensation disappears. This period is suitable for surgery and is divided into 4 levels. Level 1 (B error): Breathing is regular and the frequency is slightly faster; the eyelid reflex disappears and eye movement decreases; but the muscles are not relaxed. General surgery can be performed; Level 2 (C pair): The eyeball is fixed in the center and the pupil is not large; the respiratory rate is slightly slower, but the amplitude does not change significantly; muscle tone gradually weakens. Abdominal surgery can be performed; Level 3 (D error): Pupils begin to dilate; thoracic breathing weakens and abdominal breathing increases; blood pressure drops and muscles relax. Surgery and operations with high stimulation intensity can be performed; Level 4: The muscles are completely relaxed, breathing gradually stops, and circulation is significantly inhibited. Artificial respiration should be performed immediately and anesthesia should be lightened; (4) Stage IV (bulbar anesthesia stage) refers to respiratory cessation, undetectable blood pressure, and dilated pupils.

The patient is in a supine position, and vesicular sounds can be heard in the middle and lower lungs on both sides (more than 50% of the lungs), and the shadows on both lungs are enlarged and blurred. If an S₃ gallop (early diastolic gallop) can be heard, it is considered that the patient is accompanied by left heart failure on the basis of myocardial infarction. The skin temperature of the peripheral limbs is normal, indicating that the patient has good peripheral circulation. The diagnosis of shock cannot rely solely on blood pressure or other single indicators, but needs to be considered comprehensively. During clinical observation, shock should be suspected for those with symptoms such as sweating, excitement, rapid heart rate, low pulse pressure, or oliguria. If the patient appears apathetic, unresponsive, pale skin, shallow and rapid breathing, systolic blood pressure drops below 90 mmHg, and has oliguria, it is a sign that the patient has entered the decompensated stage of shock (Page 29 of the 9th edition of Surgery). From the above diagnostic criteria, it can be seen that the patient does not have symptoms of cardiogenic shock. In summary: the patient's Killip classification is grade III (C pair).",

        "Option D": "Adrenaline",
        "Option E": "Phenylephrine (Phenylephrine)",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Dopamine is the most commonly used vasoconstrictor, stimulating α, β₁ and dopamine receptors. Low-dose dopamine mainly excites β₁ and dopamine receptors, increases myocardial contractility, increases cardiac output, and expands kidneys and gastrointestinal blood vessels. It has the effect of protecting renal function, so it is the first choice for the treatment of shock (A pair), especially suitable For those with renal insufficiency. When dopamine cannot increase blood pressure, only other vasoactive drugs such as norepinephrine (B error), isoproterenol (C error), etc. can be combined without increasing the dose of dopamine, because it can cause systemic vasoconstriction and While blood pressure rises, it protects the basic blood supply of the heart and kidneys. In the early stage of shock, the microcirculation is in a contracted state, and vasoconstrictors (such as norepinephrine, epinephrine (False D), phenylephrine (False E), etc.) are rarely used clinically. Isoproterenol is a β-receptor agonist, which can increase myocardial contractility, accelerate heart rate, and can easily cause arrhythmia, so it should be used with caution.",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Due to the existence of peripheral resistance and the greater expansibility and elasticity of the aorta and large artery walls (pair C), only about 1/3 of the blood ejected by the left ventricle in one contraction flows to the periphery during the systole, and the rest is about 2/3 is temporarily stored in the aorta and large arteries and increases aortic pressure. Due to the elastic reservoir effect of the aorta and large arteries, the speed and amplitude of the increase in aortic pressure are buffered to an appropriate level. During ventricular diastole, the semilunar valve closes and ejection stops. The expanded aorta and great arteries retract according to their elasticity, releasing the potential energy stored during systole and continuing to push blood to the periphery, causing the aorta to press against the heart. Relaxation period can still be maintained at a high level.",

        "Explanation": "7-year-old boy suffered from paroxysmal right upper quadrant colic accompanied by vomiting. The intermittent symptoms completely disappeared and mild deep tenderness in the upper abdomen. The diagnosis was considered to be biliary ascariasis (D pair). Biliary ascariasis is a collective name for a series of clinical symptoms caused by roundworms burrowing into the biliary tract. Its typical manifestation is a sudden subxiphoid-like severe cramping when the roundworms are active, which worsens in paroxysms. When in pain, you may toss and turn, moan, and sweat profusely. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or vomiting of roundworms. It can often radiate to the right shoulder blade or back, and the abdominal pain can be relieved suddenly, and there can be no symptoms at all during the intermittent period. The pain can come and go and last for varying amounts of time. The patient with acute cholecystitis (P444) (False A) has persistent pain in the right upper quadrant, mild to moderate fever, and may have chills, and a positive Murphy sign can be found on physical examination. Duodenal ulcer (B error) is more likely to occur in young people. The typical symptom is periodic fasting pain, and most of it is burning pain rather than colic in nature. Patients with cholelithiasis (P438) (C wrong) usually have no clinical manifestations. Biliary colic is often the first symptom and may also stop spontaneously. There is generally no fever or jaundice. However, the patient is only 7 years old and the possibility of suffering from cholelithiasis is low.

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The patient breathed deeply, with a frequency of 30 times/min, and the exhaled gas had a ketone smell, which was a typical manifestation of severe acidosis. For patients with severe acidosis, simple rehydration and self-regulation alone are not enough to compensate for the harm caused by acidosis to the body. A certain amount of alkaline agent needs to be given to quickly improve the symptoms of acidosis. The most commonly used alkaline drug is 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (D pair). Generally speaking, 100ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate can increase the blood pH by 0.1. 11.2% sodium lactate solution (C pair) has also been used to treat acidosis. , but it is no longer used clinically. Whole blood transfusion (wrong A) is mainly used to rescue patients with acute massive blood loss who do not have indications for blood transfusion. Normal saline or compound sodium chloride solution (B error) is used to treat partial metabolic alkalosis and isotonic dehydration respectively. 5% sodium chloride (E error) is a hypertonic solution that can be used to correct hypotonic water shortage.",

Among all myocardial cells, sinoatrial node cells have the highest automaticity and the slowest conduction rate in the atrioventricular junction area: sinoatrial node cells have the fastest automatic depolarization rate in phase 4 action potential and the highest number of excitations per unit time. Therefore, The self-discipline is the highest; the cell diameter in the atrioventricular junction area is the smallest, the longitudinal resistance of the local current flowing along the longitudinal axis of the cell is the largest, and the spread distance of the electrotonic potential is the shortest, so the conduction speed of excitement is the slowest (pair C).",

The liver is not reached, and the spleen is 1cm below the ribs (splenomegaly). Laboratory test: Hb98g/L (Normal value for women: 110~150g/L, indicating anemia), WBC11.2×10⁹/L (normal value for adults: 4~10×10⁹/L, indicating infection), ESR85mm/h (normal value for women: 0~20mm/ h, increasing rapidly), urine protein (±) (mild proteinuria), sediment microscopy WBC10~15/HP (normal value <3/HP, microscopic hematuria), based on the patient’s medical history, clinical manifestations, signs, and experiments Based on the results of intravenous examination, the most likely diagnosis is subacute infective endocarditis. Infectious endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, heart valves or adjacent aortic intima caused by pathogenic microorganisms circulating through the bloodstream, and is accompanied by vegetations. The formation of organisms, diagnosis mainly relies on echocardiography and blood culture. About 75% to 85% of patients have positive blood culture. Positive blood culture is the most direct evidence for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis/IE, and echocardiography can detect Determining the location, size and shape of the vegetation is of great diagnostic value for patients with negative blood cultures. Therefore, echocardiography (D pair) can provide an important basis for a clear diagnosis. The current diagnostic criteria mainly refer to the Duck criteria. Chest CT (B error) is helpful in diagnosing suspected pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, abscess and hemorrhage in IE. Blood C-reactive protein (A) is an extremely sensitive indicator of acute phase response during infection, but it is not specific. It is found in a variety of purulent infections, malignant tumors, tissue necrosis and connective tissue diseases, and can be used to identify bacterial infections. and non-bacterial infections, and can also be used to identify the active and stable phases of rheumatic fever. Generally, CRP increases in organic lesions but not in functional lesions. It should be noted that pregnant women have higher CRP levels.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "An elderly male patient has experienced dull pain in the precordium area when running quickly for the past year, which lasts for 3 to 5 minutes and can be relieved after resting. Based on the clinical manifestations, the most likely diagnosis is stable angina pectoris; in the past month, the trigger threshold for chest pain has decreased, The duration is prolonged, the attack is accompanied by sweating, and the attack occurs again a day ago, which can be relieved after oral administration of nitroglycerin. ST-T changes can be seen on the electrocardiogram during chest pain attacks, that is, on the basis of relatively stable exertional angina, the angina pectoris gradually intensifies and the pain becomes more severe. Severe, longer or more frequent. Based on the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations and electrocardiogram results, the patient's coronary heart disease is classified as unstable angina (UA), and the category is worsening angina. The best treatment for this patient is revascularization therapy, that is, interventional therapy (PCI). Based on the patient’s clinical manifestations and electrocardiogram results, early interventional therapy is recommended (15th edition of Practical Internal Medicine P981). PCI is less invasive. , low risk, quick results, compared with conservative therapy with medical drugs, it can significantly improve the patient's quality of life (increased activity tolerance). With the emergence of new technologies, PCI can not only improve the quality of life, but also treat large-area myocardial defects. The incidence and mortality of MI can be significantly reduced in high-risk patients. Thrombolytic therapy (False A) is an important treatment for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. When primary PCI is expected to take more than 120 minutes, thrombolytic therapy is the first choice, and we strive to give the patient thrombolytic drugs within 10 minutes. Beta-receptor antagonists (D error) and long-acting oral nitroglycerin (B error) are drug treatments that improve myocardial ischemia and relieve symptoms, and are drug treatments for coronary heart disease.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "For a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, after one week of treatment, his body temperature became normal, his symptoms of palpitations and shortness of breath were relieved, he could lie down at night, and the edema of his lower limbs disappeared. His pulse was 68 beats/min, BP 125/70mmHg, heart rate 92 beats/min, and his heart rhythm was absolutely irregular, indicating that the patient After treatment, the symptoms of acute heart failure are relieved, accompanied by arrhythmia and cardioectasia. The treatment principle for cardiac insufficiency is to reduce ventricular remodeling and further myocardial damage, delay the development of the disease, and treat according to the chronic heart failure treatment guidelines, ACEI or ARB class Drugs (A pair) and aldosterone receptor antagonists (C pair) can block one of the central links in the development of heart failure - the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can delay ventricular remodeling and reduce mortality; β Receptor antagonists (B pair) can inhibit the adverse effects of sympathetic nerve activation on heart failure compensation. In principle, all patients with cardiac insufficiency who are stable and have no contraindications should start using β-receptors at a low dose as soon as they are diagnosed. Antagonists, gradually increased to the maximum tolerated dose and maintained for a long time, can delay disease progression and reduce sudden death.

According to the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, signs and imaging examinations As a result, the most likely diagnosis is hyperthyroidism. At this time, atrial fibrillation is complicated by thyrotoxic heart disease. Patients with hyperthyroidism often develop arrhythmias regardless of whether they have heart disease or not, often with atrial premature contractions and atrial premature contractions.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "In patients with intestinal obstruction, nausea, vomiting, oliguria, increased urine specific gravity, sunken eye sockets, clammy extremities, low blood pressure, and normal serum sodium, isotonic dehydration should be considered for diagnosis (intestinal obstruction often causes acute dehydration, and serum sodium is normal) . During treatment, the cause should be actively corrected and the reduction of extracellular fluid should be corrected in a targeted manner. Normal saline is an isotonic solution, but the Cl⁻ content is 50mmol/L higher than the serum Cl⁻ content (the Cl⁻ contents in normal saline and plasma are 154mmol/L and 103mmol/L respectively). Large-scale infusion can cause blood Cl⁻ If it is too high, there is a risk of causing hyperchloric acidosis. The electrolyte content of balanced salt solution (C pair) is similar to that in plasma, which is better than isotonic saline solution with high Cl⁻ level (B pair), and is ideal for treating isotonic dehydration. 5% sodium chloride solution (D error) is a hypertonic solution that can be used to treat hypotonic dehydration, correct the hypotonic state of extracellular fluid and replenish blood volume (P11). 5% glucose (A) is a sodium-free isotonic solution that can replenish blood volume. However, when used to treat isotonic dehydration, it can easily cause dilutional hyponatremia. It is mostly used to treat hypertonic dehydration.",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The patient has no history of angina pectoris, which is new in the past 2 weeks, and can be induced by very light physical activity within 1 to 2 months of the first symptoms (the above symptoms have been felt in the past week after consciously walking up a floor, and oral nitroglycerin is effective) ), so it belongs to primary angina pectoris among unstable angina pectoris (pair C). The onset of variant angina (B error) has nothing to do with activity and is more likely to occur in young people. This disease is mainly caused by coronary artery spasm, so commonly used drugs are calcium channel blockers and nitrates. Worsened angina (D error) refers to the gradually increasing level of angina on the basis of relatively stable exertional angina (the pain is more severe, longer or more frequent, and increases to at least level I or to at least CCS level III according to CCS classification). Exertional angina (P219) (False A) is a type of stable angina in which the degree, frequency, nature and triggering factors of pain attacks remain unchanged for weeks to months.",

        "Option E": "Azotemia returns to normal during polyuria phase",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "In the oliguric stage of acute kidney injury, reduced renal potassium excretion, acidosis, and rapid tissue decomposition jointly lead to elevated blood potassium and lead to hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia causes cardiac electrophysiological disorders and even cardiac arrest, leading to sudden death. Hyperkalemia Anemia is the leading cause of death in the oliguric phase (pair D). In renal acute renal failure, the concentrating function of the renal tubules is impaired, and hypotonic urine is often excreted (False A), with the urine specific gravity fixed between 1.010 and 1.014. A significant decrease in urine output is the most prominent manifestation of impaired renal function. However, in the later stages of acute renal failure, urine output increases, and the daily urine output can reach 3,000 to 5,000 ml. Therefore, urine output is not the only indicator for judging whether there is acute renal failure (B is wrong) ). About 60% of acute renal failure is related to trauma and surgery (False C), and about 40% is caused by hemodynamic changes caused by medical reasons or caused by nephrotoxins. In the early stage of polyuria, the patient is still in a state of azotemia (E error) and water and electrolyte imbalance. The creatinine and serum potassium levels are still high, and they return to normal as the renal function gradually recovers.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Abdominal pain caused by common bile duct stones often occurs under the xiphoid process or in the right upper quadrant. It is usually colic, occurs in paroxysmal attacks, or is persistent pain that worsens paroxysmally. It can radiate to the right shoulder or back, and is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting (A Wrong, this is the correct answer to this question). In addition to ureteral stones, paroxysmal colic can also be seen in mechanical intestinal obstruction (B pair). Paroxysmal piercing pain under the xiphoid process that stops suddenly, severe symptoms and mild signs are inconsistent with biliary ascariasis (pair C). Severe knife-like pain in the upper abdomen, accompanied by peritoneal irritation signs, and crescent-shaped free gas under the diaphragm can be seen on the X-ray film, which is mostly due to perforation of peptic ulcer (D pair).

        "Explanation": "Systematic post-resuscitation care (PCAC) can not only reduce early mortality caused by circulatory instability after resuscitation, and late mortality caused by multiple organ dysfunction and brain damage, but also improve patients' quality of life. Therefore, after the patient recovers spontaneous circulation, he should be immediately transferred to a medical unit with ICU conditions for post-resuscitation treatment. The main content of post-resuscitation treatment is to prevent and treat hypoxic brain injury and multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Maintaining stable respiratory and circulatory functions is a prerequisite. After 120 arrived, they first took over the patient's chest compressions and artificial respiration, and monitored various physiological indicators (Pair A); for those with life-threatening arrhythmias, emergency personnel carried electric defibrillators and provided electrical cardioversion correction.

Established (pair C). In addition to measuring the systemic blood volume, CVP can also be used as a reference indicator during fluid replenishment. The patient needs to continue fluid replenishment to expand the blood volume. After the blood volume is restored, conservative or surgical treatment will be selected according to the severity of peritonitis symptoms.

        "Option D": "stomach cancer",
        "Option E": "stress ulcer",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. COX is the rate-limiting enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism and has two isomers: structural COX-1 and inducible COX-2. COX-1 is constantly expressed in trace amounts in tissue cells and contributes to the repair of epithelial cells. COX-2 is mainly expressed by inflammation and promotes the production of inflammatory mediators. Non-specific COX inhibitors are designed to inhibit COX-2, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. However, due to poor specificity, they also inhibit COX-1, resulting in insufficient prostaglandin E to maintain normal mucosal regeneration, mucosal repair disorders, and erosion and bleeding. This patient developed gastrointestinal bleeding 6 hours after taking salicylic acid preparations (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The most likely cause of bleeding was acute gastritis (pair C). Stress ulcers (E wrong) generally refer to acute gastric mucosal lesions that occur after shock, trauma, surgery, and severe systemic infection. They are often accompanied by bleeding symptoms. This patient has no above-mentioned predisposing factors, and stress ulcers are not considered. Note: Short-term use of large amounts of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause acute gastritis, and long-term use can cause peptic ulcers. Gastric and duodenal ulcers (wrong A) often have a history of chronic and recurring ulcers, which is inconsistent with this case. Patients with portal hypertension and esophageal variceal bleeding (B error) often have a history of liver disease, which is not mentioned in this case. Ulcerative gastric cancer (wrong D) in gastric cancer (D) can cause vomiting of blood when bleeding. However, gastric cancer occurs at an older age and often causes long-term upper abdominal pain, anorexia, anorexia, fatigue and weight loss.",

        "Question": "Which of the following statements about organ transplantation is incorrect?",

        "Option B": "Kidney transplantation is the most stable and most effective among all types of clinical organ transplantation.",

        "Option D": "The leading cause of recent death after lung transplantation is lung infection",
        "Option E": "Preventing rejection after small intestine transplantation is easier",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "The most commonly used organ transplantation in clinical practice is allogeneic transplantation. Immune rejection is the main obstacle that affects the effectiveness of transplantation. The essence of immune rejection is a donor-specific immune response. Due to chronic rejection, coronary artery sclerosis will occur over a period of time after heart transplantation, and current immunosuppressants are ineffective against chronic rejection. Chronic rejection is also one of the biggest obstacles to organ transplantation (pair A). The surgical procedure for kidney transplantation has been basically finalized. Life-long post-operative immunosuppressive therapy can well control rejection and is tolerated by the vast majority of patients. It is the most stable and significant efficacy among all types of clinical organ transplantation (pair B). . The cause of Type 1 diabetes is the inability of the own pancreatic islet cells to produce insulin, causing a complete lack of insulin. Transplanting pancreatic cells with normal functions can provide the body with the necessary insulin. Therefore, pancreas transplantation can treat ineffective Type 1 diabetes (C right). After lung transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are required to suppress rejection, which inevitably reduces the patient's resistance. The lungs are organs that are directly connected to the outside world and are bound to be exposed to external pathogenic microorganisms. Severe pulmonary disease is prone to occur under immunosuppression. External infection is life-threatening (pair D). The small intestine is a highly immunogenic organ, and its lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes contain a large amount of lymphoid tissue, resulting in a very high incidence of rejection. It is difficult to prevent rejection after transplantation (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Option C": "Fast heart rate, abnormal heart rhythm",
        "Option D": "metabolic alkalosis",
        "Option E": "Urine output is small and alkaline",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Potassium ion is an important ion for maintaining the electrical balance inside and outside cells. If it is too high or too low, it will inevitably cause cell instability and have a serious impact on muscle activity, heart rhythm, etc. The clinical manifestations of hypokalemia are mainly divided into motor system manifestations, digestive system manifestations, cardiac arrhythmia, and metabolic alkalosis (low potassium and low chloride can cause alkalosis). The main manifestations of the motor system are muscle weakness, and may also include flaccid paralysis, decreased or absent tendon reflexes (pair A). The main manifestations of the digestive system include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, loss of intestinal motility and other symptoms of intestinal paralysis (pair B). The main manifestations of arrhythmia are increased myocardial stress in the early stage, tachycardia, and premature atrial and ventricular contractions, and bradycardia in the late stage due to conduction block (pair C). The reason why hypokalemia causes metabolic alkalosis (D pair) is that on the one hand, potassium ions move out of cells and increase exchange with sodium and hydrogen ions, reducing the concentration of extracellular hydrogen ions; on the other hand, sodium and potassium ions in the distal renal tubule The exchange decreases and the exchange of sodium and hydrogen ions increases, resulting in increased hydrogen excretion. These two effects can cause patients to develop hypokalemic alkalosis. At this time, the amount of hydrogen ions in the urine increases and becomes acidic, causing abnormal acidic urine (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Question": "Which of the following is incorrect regarding endotracheal intubation?",

        "Option B": "Orotracheal intubation of comatose patients is generally limited to 24 to 28 hours. If it exceeds this limit, tracheotomy should be performed.",
        "Option C": "Infants and young children generally do not need cuffed catheters",
        "Option D": "In patients with mandibular hypoplasia, transoral photopic intubation is often difficult.",
        "Option E": "Intraoral surgery, transnasal intubation surgery is convenient",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The main bronchi divides downward into left and right bronchi. The left bronchi is slightly elevated due to the influence of the heart, while the right bronchi is steeper and straighter. Therefore, if the endotracheal intubation is not performed properly and is inserted too deep, it will easily enter the right bronchus (A is wrong) , is the correct answer to this question). Orotracheal intubation of comatose patients may cause ischemic damage due to the compression of the local tracheal wall by the intubation tube and the front inflated balloon. Therefore, it is generally limited to 24 to 28 hours. If it exceeds this limit, a tracheotomy should be performed (B right). Classically, it is believed that it is best to use an uncuffed endotracheal tube in younger children to prevent post-extubation stridor; many studies in recent years have found that the use of cuffed endotracheal tubes does not increase post-extubation stridor in children. The incidence of comorbidities, especially the emergence of low-pressure cuff catheters, and the variability in subglottic shape in children are also significant. Therefore, these views are no longer applicable to modern clinical practice (C was considered correct in the past, but now this view is controversial). Patients with mandibular hypoplasia are usually unable to directly observe the glottis through the mouth because they cannot open and close their mouths widely, so it is difficult for such patients to perform tracheal intubation with direct vision through the mouth (pair D). For intraoral surgery, transnasal intubation can provide sufficient space and good vision for intraoral operations, and prevent foreign objects from entering the trachea, which facilitates the operation (Pair E).",

        "Question": "Which of the following is correct regarding drug preparation before hyperthyroidism surgery?",
        "Option A": "Propranolol cannot be combined with iodine",
        "Option B": "Thiourea drugs and iodine cannot be used together",
        "Option C": "Take thiourea drugs to control symptoms of hyperthyroidism before undergoing surgery",
        "Option D": "After using iodine for 2 to 3 weeks, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be basically controlled before surgery can be performed.",
        "Option E": "Propranolol should be administered every 8 hours when taking it, and should be continued for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "After using iodine for 2 to 3 weeks, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be basically controlled before surgery (right D). This method is suitable for patients with mild symptoms, secondary hyperthyroidism and high-functioning adenomas. When using thiourea drugs, you need to pay attention to the preoperative preparation. Since thiourea drugs can cause goiter and arterial congestion, bleeding is very likely to occur during surgery, which increases the difficulty and risk of the operation. Therefore, you must add thiourea drugs after taking them. Use iodine for 2 weeks until the thyroid gland shrinks and hardens, and the number of blood vessels decreases before surgery. This is a common test point (BC error). Propranolol is a β-receptor blocker that can control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism (blocking the conversion of T₄ to T₃ in peripheral tissues), shortens the preoperative preparation time, and does not cause gland congestion after administration, which is conducive to surgery. Operation, those who have poor effect or severe reaction to thiourea drugs can use this drug instead, or it can be combined with iodine agent for preoperative preparation (A error); the dosage starts from 60mg/d, every 6 hours/time, usually 4 When the heart rate drops to normal level after 7 days, surgery can be performed; since the half-life of propranolol in the body is less than 8 hours, it must be taken orally 1 to 2 hours before surgery, and it can be continued for 4 to 7 days after surgery.

        "Question": "In preoperative preparation, which of the following is incorrect?",
        "Option A": "Heart failure patients need to be under control for 3 to 4 weeks before surgery",
        "Option B": "Patients with frequent asthma attacks can take dexamethasone 0.75 mg orally three times a day.",
        "Option C": "People with severe liver function impairment are generally not suitable for any surgery.",
        "Option D": "Patients with severe renal impairment can still safely tolerate surgery as long as they are treated with effective dialysis therapy",
        "Option E": "Before major surgery, diabetic patients must control their blood sugar to a normal level and have negative urine sugar levels before surgery.",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "It is the view of the Seventh Edition of Surgery that patients with heart failure need to be under control for 3 to 4 weeks before surgery. The current view is that for patients with heart disease, the Goldman index is commonly used to quantify the risk of cardiac death and life-threatening complications. The higher the score, the higher the risk. The higher the rate, the higher the risk of cardiac complications and patient mortality (A used to be the correct answer, but is now deprecated). Patients with frequent asthma attacks can take 0.75 mg of dexamethasone orally three times a day. Dexamethasone has a strong anti-inflammatory effect, can relieve respiratory mucosal edema and spasm, and effectively prevent asthma attacks (B pair). People with severe liver function impairment are usually accompanied by a series of problems such as coagulation disorders and hypoalbuminemia. They have poor tolerance for surgery and have extremely high mortality. In this case, it is generally not suitable to perform any surgery (pair C). Hemodialysis is one of the renal replacement treatments for patients with acute and chronic renal failure. Nowadays, hemodialysis can replace most of the functions of the kidneys, allowing patients with end-stage uremia to survive better. For patients with severe renal function impairment, as long as they receive effective dialysis therapy Only after treatment can the surgery be tolerated safely (D pair). Diabetic patients should maintain a mildly elevated blood sugar state (5.6-11.2mmol/L) during surgery to avoid hypoglycemia caused by excessive blood sugar consumption during surgery (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Option C": "Cervical spondylosis may cause symptoms such as blurred vision, double vision, tinnitus, and precordial pain.",
        "Option D": "Cervical spondylosis is caused by bone hyperplasia in the cervical vertebrae and is often accompanied by radiating pain and sensory disturbances in the upper limbs.",
        "Option E": "All patients with cervical spondylosis should undergo cervical spine X-ray examination",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "This question is not rigorous and does not differentiate between different types of cervical spondylosis. Conservative treatment is preferred for nerve root, sympathetic, and vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis, and only those who meet the surgical indications can choose surgical treatment; cervical spondylotic myelopathy can easily cause varying degrees of disability of the limbs, and surgical treatment has poor results after long-term spinal cord compression and repeated stimulation. Therefore, once the diagnosis is clear, early surgical treatment should be performed. Massage and traction are not suitable for this type of patients (A is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). For vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis, the cause is the reduction in diameter or lumen obstruction of the vertebral artery due to various reasons, causing a series of symptoms caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain (pair B). Vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis can be caused by insufficiency of blood supply to the basilar artery, causing migraine, tinnitus, visual impairment, sudden dizziness, etc. Because there are a large number of sympathetic postganglionic fibers around the vertebral artery, palpitation, arrhythmia, and other spontaneous symptoms can occur. Neurological symptoms (pair C). There are many causes of cervical spondylosis. In addition to degenerative lesions of cervical spine tissue, cervical bone hyperplasia can also cause nerve roots to be compressed, resulting in radiating pain and sensory disturbances in the upper limbs at the areas innervated by the compressed nerve roots (pair D). X-rays can show changes in cervical spine curvature, and combined with corresponding clinical manifestations, provide evidence for the diagnosis and classification of cervical spondylosis. Therefore, cervical spine X-ray examination (Pair E) should be performed for all cervical spondylosis.",

When CVP﹤5cmH₂O, it indicates insufficient blood volume (C pair); when CVP>15cmH₂O, it indicates cardiac insufficiency, excessive contraction of the venous vascular bed, or increased pulmonary circulation resistance (D pair). Blood volume and venous vascular tension can affect the volume of venous blood return to the heart, thereby affecting central venous pressure (E pair). During the compensatory phase of shock, the body's effective circulating blood volume decreases, the amount of blood returned to the heart decreases, and the central venous pressure decreases. However, due to sympathetic nerve excitement, cardiac contraction is enhanced, blood vessels throughout the body are constricted, and blood pressure can be maintained at normal levels.

        "Explanation": "The conduction speed of myocardium is related to the diameter of myocardial cells. Cells with smaller diameters have larger longitudinal resistance, shorter spread distance of electrotonic potential, and slower conduction speed of excitement. The diameters of atrial myocardium, ventricular myocardium and Purkinje cells are all larger, and the diameter of terminal Purkinje cells is the largest. In some animals, its diameter can reach 70 μm, so the conduction speed of excitement is very fast. The diameter of the P cells in the sinoatrial node is very small (5-10 μm) and the conduction speed is very slow; the diameter of the cells in the atrioventricular junction area is even smaller, about 0.3 μm, and the conduction speed is the slowest (pair C).",

        "Explanation": "Hyperthyroidism refers to a group of clinical syndromes characterized by increased excitability and hypermetabolism in the nervous, circulatory, digestive and other systems caused by excessive thyroid hormone in the blood circulation. Beta-receptor blockers (such as propranolol, also known as propranolol) improve the symptoms of sympathetic activation caused by hyperthyroidism by blocking beta-receptors, weakening the effect of thyroid hormones in the body. However, since propranolol has no selectivity for β₁ and β₂ receptors, it will block the bronchospasm caused by β₂ receptor activation during the medication, causing asthma attacks. Therefore, propranolol is contraindicated in patients with hyperthyroidism and severe asthma (pair A).",

        "Explanation": "young male patient developed abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting of bile-like liquid without food after Bi-type II subtotal gastrectomy. Physical examination revealed upper abdominal fullness and mild tenderness. A input loop obstruction was considered for diagnosis (pair B). After gastric surgery, the input loop is obstructed, and bile and digestive juice secreted by the pancreas accumulate in the duodenal stump. When the intra-abdominal pressure rises, bile may be vomited. Because the output loop is unobstructed, food can pass through without obstruction, so the vomitus is No food. When the anastomotic stoma is obstructed (A error), food cannot pass through the anastomotic stoma, but bile can descend through the output loop, which is often manifested as vomiting of food and liquid that does not contain bile. When the output loop is obstructed (False C), neither bile nor food can pass down through the output loop, and the vomitus contains both bile and food. Dumping syndrome (D error) includes early dumping syndrome and late dumping syndrome. Early dumping syndrome usually occurs half an hour after eating, and is manifested by symptoms of hypovolemia such as heart palpitations, cold sweats, and pale complexion. This may be caused by the rapid entry of hypertonic gastric contents into the intestinal lumen, causing intestinal endocrine cells to secrete a large amount of vasoactive substances. Related; Late dumping syndrome occurs 2 to 4 hours after eating, and is mainly characterized by hypoglycemia syndrome. It may be caused by food entering the intestines and stimulating a large amount of insulin secretion, leading to reactive hypoglycemia.",

Insufficient oxygen supply and increased demand are the essence of shock (A is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). During shock, the afferent blood vessels of the kidneys spasm due to decreased blood pressure and increased secretion of catecholamines, resulting in decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (pair D). In the early stage of shock, the sympathetic nerves are excited, and the blood vessels of unimportant organs (such as the stomach, intestines, kidneys, etc.) constrict, while the blood vessels of important organs (such as the heart, brain) constrict less obviously (pair C). During the shock suppression period, lactic acid and other metabolites accumulate, and the arterioles and precapillary sphincters are sensitive to it and relax. The venules behind the capillaries are insensitive to it and are still in a state of contraction. There is \"only ingress but no outflow\" in the microcirculation.

        "Explanation": "(Eighth Edition Physiology P182) CO₂ accumulation mainly presents clinical manifestations of acidosis: a drop in blood pH stimulates the carotid body and aortic body, causing the heart rate to increase and blood pressure to accelerate blood flow and compensate for the hypoxic state of the body's tissues; respiration Increase and deepen to expel excess CO₂. When CO₂ is quickly discharged, blood acidosis is relieved, causing the body's blood pressure to drop; but for breathing, central chemoreceptors play a major role in the ventilatory response caused by CO₂. The rapid discharge of CO₂ causes PCO₂ in the blood to drop too fast, and low PCO₂ The blood reaches the brain, and the respiratory center is inhibited due to lack of sufficient CO₂ stimulation, so breathing becomes slow, shallow or even stops (pair A). For patients who are comatose due to high PCO₂, CO₂ must not be discharged through rapid ventilation. Oxygen should be given slowly and at low flow to maintain low blood O₂ and stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors to maintain breathing.",

It was considered that the drainage was not smooth. The hematoma and bleeding in the incision compressed the airway (D pair), causing dyspnea. The main clinical manifestations of thyroid storm (A error) are high fever (﹥39℃), increased heart rate (﹥120 beats/min), and severe functional disorders of the nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, such as irritability, delirium, profuse sweating, and vomiting. , watery diarrhea, etc., but no dyspnea. Tracheal collapse (B error) is the result of long-term compression of the tracheal wall by the enlarged thyroid gland and softening of the tracheal wall. After removal of most of the thyroid gland, the softened tracheal wall loses support. It often occurs immediately after surgery and generally does not wait until the night after surgery. . Laryngeal edema (C error) mostly occurs in infants and young children and those with difficulty in endotracheal intubation. It can also be caused by surgical traction or stimulation of the larynx, excessive preoperative antithyroid drugs, and it is easy to occur in patients with hypothyroidism. Dyspnea and asphyxia caused by bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (E error) will occur immediately after the recurrent laryngeal nerve is injured during surgery, and will not occur until the night after surgery.",

Physical examination revealed bleeding blisters on the oral mucosa, and the amount of bleeding worsened. PLT was 8×10⁹/L (<10×10⁹/L, severe ITP). The clinical diagnosis is ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). ITP patients have thrombocytopenia, bone marrow hyperplasia, normal or increased megakaryocyte count, maturity disorders, and a significant decrease in the number of plate-forming megakaryocytes (pair D). ITP can have varying degrees of normocytic or microcytic hypochromic anemia (False A). Positive antinuclear antibodies and positive antiphospholipid antibodies (B error) are more common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cardiolipin antibodies can be detected in some ITP patients, but they have no diagnostic specificity. Coagulation time (CT) reflects the function of the endogenous coagulation system and has nothing to do with platelets. CT in patients with ITP is normal; platelets participate in blood clot contraction, and patients with ITP have reduced thrombocytopenia, so blood clot shrinkage is poor (C is wrong).",

        "Explanation": "The early stage of shock is also called the shock compensatory period. The decrease in blood pressure in the early stage of shock triggers the vasomotor central pressor reflex through the aortic arch and carotid sinus baroreceptors, and the excitement of the sympatho-adrenal axis leads to the release of large amounts of catecholamines. Catecholamines can constrict small blood vessels in the periphery (skin, skeletal muscles) and internal organs (such as liver, spleen, gastrointestinal, lungs, kidneys) and reduce blood flow (ACD error). The coronary arteries are mainly affected by the level of myocardial metabolism. Myocardial metabolism is enhanced and metabolic products accumulate, causing coronary artery dilation. Although catecholamines can constrict coronary arteries, they can also increase myocardial metabolism and cause coronary vasodilation. In the intact body, the influence of neurological factors is masked by changes caused by changes in myocardial metabolism.

        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "\"Male, 50 years old, with a reversible mass in the right scrotum for 14 years\" indicates that the patient has an indirect inguinal hernia. \"Cannot return to bed for 1 day, accompanied by vomiting, stopping defecation and exhaustion\" indicates an incarcerated inguinal hernia. \"Abdominal distension and hyperactive bowel sounds\" indicate that the impaction is likely to be intestinal tube. \"Cannot return for 1 day\" and the presence of peritoneal irritation sign indicate that the impacted intestine has been strangulated and necrotic. Therefore, the first treatment consideration is emergency inguinal hernia surgery and preparation for intestinal resection (pair E). Intestinal strangulation is one of the surgical emergencies and requires emergency surgery. Therefore, it is not allowed to be kept in the emergency room for observation (wrong B), nor can it simply undergo gastrointestinal decompression and undergo elective repair (wrong D). Analgesic and anti-inflammatory (C wrong) are general symptomatic treatments and cannot fundamentally eliminate the cause of the disease. This question is not rigorous.

Its typical manifestation is a sudden subxiphoid-like severe cramping when the roundworms are active, which worsens in paroxysms. When in pain, you may toss and turn, moan, and sweat profusely. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or vomiting of roundworms. It can often radiate to the right shoulder blade or back, and the abdominal pain can be relieved suddenly, and there can be no symptoms at all during the intermittent period. The pain can come and go and last for varying amounts of time. Acute cholecystitis (A) is mainly pain in the upper abdomen. It starts with distension and discomfort in the morning and gradually develops into paroxysmal colic. Attacks are common at night and are often triggered by a heavy meal or fatty food. The pain radiates to the right shoulder, scapula and back. Abdominal pain in acute pancreatitis (B error) often occurs suddenly after eating and drinking.

        "Explanation": "The sartorius muscle originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts on the medial surface of the upper end of the tibia. Its main function is to flex the hips and knees. When the patient was playing basketball, the sartorius muscle contracted violently during the collision, and the explosive traction force produced acted on the ossification center of the pelvic apophysis, causing an avulsion injury. This was caused by muscle contraction, so it was caused by indirect violence. (Pair B).",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The fracture line of subfemoral head fracture is located under the femoral head. The femoral head has only a small amount of blood supply from the foveolar artery, resulting in severe ischemia of the femoral head. Therefore, there is a high chance of avascular necrosis of the femoral head; the elderly have poor circulation. , with a low metabolic rate, the possibility of spontaneous healing after a femoral neck fracture is extremely low. In order to avoid the risk of femoral head necrosis and secondary surgery, total hip artificial joint replacement is considered a priority for elderly patients with subcapital fractures of the femoral neck (pair D).

        "Explanation": "young male patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and signs of peritonitis after exercising strenuously after eating a full meal. Neither blood amylase nor abdominal amylase was significantly elevated. There was bloody fluid in the abdominal puncture, and strangulating intestinal obstruction was considered for diagnosis. The weight of the intestinal loops increases after a full meal, and the sudden change in body position during strenuous exercise causes the intestinal loops to move asynchronously, causing the intestinal loops with a fixed axis position and a certain weight to twist, and the mesentery of the twisted intestinal segment also twists. As a result, its blood supply is reduced and intestinal ischemic necrosis is prone to occur, that is, strangulating intestinal obstruction (E pair). Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (wrong A) is pain in the left upper quadrant, accompanied by radiating pain in the left shoulder and left waist. Serum and abdominal amylase are generally elevated (normal values are about 40 to 180 U/dL). Acute cholecystitis (B error) is mostly caused by paroxysmal cramping in the right upper quadrant, and peritoneal irritation signs are usually located in the right upper quadrant. Acute appendicitis (C wrong) is metastatic right lower quadrant pain, right lower quadrant tenderness and rebound pain. Upper gastrointestinal perforation (D error) is persistent severe pain in the upper abdomen. Later, due to the gastrointestinal contents flowing into the right lower abdomen along the right paracolic groove, the clinical manifestation is that the upper abdominal pain spreads to the right lower abdomen or even the entire abdomen.",

Laboratory tests: TgAb (-), TPOAb (-), TRAb (+) (Graves’ diagnostic conditions), liver function and blood routine tests are normal. Based on the patient’s medical history, physical examination results, and laboratory tests, the most likely diagnosis is Antithyroid drugs are the first choice for treatment of Graves' disease. Although ATD can cross the placenta, propylthiouracil has better water solubility and is less likely to enter the fetus. Therefore, the risk of teratogenesis of PTU is less than that of MMI. If the patient wishes to For pregnancy and childbirth within the year, propylthiouracil PTU treatment is the first choice (pair C). Regarding Graves' first choice of ATD, there are reports of liver transplantation due to hepatocellular damage caused by propylthiouracil, except for patients in the first 3 months of pregnancy, thyroid storm, little response to methimazole treatment, and those who refuse radioactive iodine or surgical treatment. In addition to propylthiouracil, patients with Graves' disease should consider methimazole (MMI). At the same time, the use of levothyroxine is not recommended during ATD treatment (D is wrong). The principle of I¹³¹ treatment (B error) is to destroy part of the thyroid gland. In some countries, it is the first choice treatment for Graves' disease. However, due to its radioactivity, pregnant and lactating women are contraindicated for treatment. Metoprolol (A) is a beta-blocker. In the treatment of Graves' disease, beta-blockers can quickly block the effects of catecholamines and improve palpitations, irritability, sweating, hand tremors, etc. in patients with hyperthyroidism. For symptoms of sympathetic system excitement, the commonly used drug in clinical practice is propranolol, which is used as auxiliary treatment or in preoperative preparation, especially in patients with more severe symptoms such as hyperthyroidism or palpitations.",

        "Option E": "Electrical defibrillation is the most effective method for treating ventricular fibrillation",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Cardiac arrest refers to a state in which the heart suddenly loses its blood-discharging function, resulting in cessation of blood circulation throughout the body and tissue ischemia and hypoxia. Judging from the functional status of the heart, cardiac arrest includes: ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, pulseless cardiac electrical activity and asystole, excluding atrial fibrillation (error A). In the event of an emergency and insufficient emergency equipment, the patient should be given basic life support (BLS), which mainly includes three steps as early as possible: ① Identify cardiac arrest as early as possible and activate the emergency medical service system ② Start CPR as early as possible: including cardiac compressions and manual breathe. The position of external chest compressions is the middle and lower 1/3 of the sternum or the upper sternum at the midpoint of the line connecting the two nipples (wrong D). The frequency is at least 100 to 120 times/min. The compression depth is 5 to 6cm for adults and at least the anteroposterior diameter of the chest for children. 1/3, pre-pubescent children are about 5cm, babies under 1 year old are about 4cm, and the chest fully rebounds after each compression. ③Electrical defibrillation as soon as possible: The incidence of ventricular fibrillation is the highest in cardiac arrest, and electric defibrillation is currently the most effective method to treat ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (E pair). Since intracardiac injection causes many complications, such as tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, myocardial or coronary vessel tears, etc., it is generally not used. The preferred route of administration during cardiac resuscitation is intravenous or intraosseous injection (B is wrong). For cardiac resuscitation medication, epinephrine (C is wrong) is the first choice. Studies have shown that using epinephrine during cardiac compressions can significantly increase coronary and endocardial blood flow, and can increase cerebral blood flow.

Based on the patient's clinical manifestations and laboratory tests, the patient is considered to be diagnosed as SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus (pair C). This case needs to be differentiated from Behcet's disease. Oral ulcers can appear in systemic lupus erythematosus and Behcet's disease, as well as in other autoimmune diseases. Behcet's disease (B error) basically manifests as oral ulcers. Ulcers occur at least 3 times a year (recurrent oral ulcers are required to diagnose Behcet's disease), accompanied by vulvar ulcers, erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis and ophthalmia. Kidney involvement is extremely rare. There is currently no specific test According to the laboratory examination indicators, according to the diagnostic criteria (P845) proposed by the International Behcet's Disease Study Group in 1990, this case did not meet the diagnostic criteria for Behcet's disease. Aplastic anemia (A error) mainly presents symptoms such as anemia, infection, and bleeding, with severe pancytopenia, and the reticulocyte percentage is mostly less than 0.5% (P547). Acute glomerulonephritis (D error) is more common in children, more in men than women. It usually starts 1 to 3 weeks (average about 10 days) after the previous infection.

High-pitched and short additional sounds in mid-late systole and late systolic murmurs could be heard on the inside of the apex. Papillary muscle function was considered. Not complete. Papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture is the most common complication of acute myocardial infarction. Mid-late systolic clicks (C pair) and blowing-like systolic murmurs appear in the apical area. The mechanism is: ischemia and necrosis of the mitral valve papillary muscles, etc. Impaired systolic function, resulting in varying degrees of mitral valve prolapse and insufficiency. Pericardial friction rub (A error) is a loud systolic murmur in the precordium or the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal edge. The murmur may be enhanced during deep inhalation and can be seen in post-myocardial infarction syndrome.

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Tetanus bacilli are Gram-positive anaerobic Clostridium spp. (AC pair). The spores are located on one side of the body and are in the shape of a pestle. They are widely found in dust, soil and feces. Bacteria are easy to kill, and spores have special resistance, so they are mainly distributed in nature in the form of spores (B is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). Tetanus bacilli cannot invade normal skin and mucous membranes, so tetanus occurs after trauma. Tetanus bacilli only stay in the wound and reproduce locally, and the exotoxins (D pair) they produce include spasm toxin and hemolytic toxin. Typical clinical manifestations are mainly caused by spasmodic toxins. Based on muscle tension and contraction, there are paroxysmal strong spasms. The first muscle group affected is the masseter muscle, followed by the facial expression muscles, neck, back, abdomen, and limb muscles. Finally, there is the diaphragm; the typical sign is a wry smile. Hemolytic toxins can cause myocardial damage and local tissue necrosis.",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Cholelithiasis includes intrahepatic bile duct stones and extrahepatic bile duct stones. Intrahepatic bile duct stones are more common in the left lateral lobe and right posterior lobe (A is wrong). Most gallbladder stones are multiple, mostly cholesterol stones, and mixed stones can occur in cases of infection (pair B). The shape of bile pigment stones is variable and can be lumpy, mud-like, or small gravel-like. The cross-section of larger stones can show an annual ring-like layered structure (C error). Cholesterol stones include pure cholesterol stones and mixed stones, the latter having a radial cross section in the center and a layered periphery. Biliary tract infection and bile stasis are the main causes of the formation of pigment stones. Biliary ascariasis is an important cause of biliary infection. Ascaris residues can serve as the core of gallstones and play an important role in the formation of pigment stones (D error). Extrahepatic bile duct stones refer to stones that occur in the common hepatic duct and common bile duct. Common bile duct stones are the most common. Extrahepatic bile duct stones account for 20% to 30% of all gallstones. Bile excretion can drive stones downward, so stones are mostly located in Common hepatic duct or lower section of common bile duct (E wrong).",

A mid-to-late systolic wind-like murmur of grade 3/6 could be heard at the apex of the heart, and he was diagnosed with papillary muscle insufficiency. Elevation of creatine kinase isoenzyme CK-MB: It increases within 4 hours after the onset of illness, reaches a peak at 16 to 24 hours, and returns to normal in 3 to 4 days. The degree of increase can more accurately reflect the scope of infarction. CK-MB is not as sensitive as cTnT and cTnI, but it can return to normal 3 to 4 days after myocardial infarction. If CK-MB rises again, it indicates another myocardial infarction (pair B), so its diagnostic significance is the greatest. Troponin T (cTnT): Troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) rises 3 to 4 hours after onset, cTnI reaches a peak at 11 to 24 hours, drops to normal in 7 to 10 days, and cTnT reaches a peak at 24 hours It reaches the peak in ~48 hours and drops to normal in 10-14 days.

        "Explanation": "The patient has the symptoms of atrial fibrillation: irregular heartbeat, heart rate greater than the pulse rate, that is, short pulse, which can be accompanied by atrial fibrillation. The fourth heart sound is the vibration produced by the forceful contraction of the atrial muscle at the end of atrial systole to overcome the pressure at the end of ventricular diastole. It is also called atrial sound. In atrial fibrillation, the atria are unable to contract effectively. Therefore, it is impossible to hear the fourth heart sound (C is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The varying intensity of the first heart sound at the apex (pair A) is one of the typical manifestations of atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, if the anterior leaflet is supple and mobile, early diastolic valve opening sound and early diastolic opening sound can be heard at the apex (B pair). When pulmonary hypertension occurs in mitral stenosis, the right ventricular ejection time is prolonged, the S₂ component formed by pulmonary valve closure is delayed, and the time difference between the S₂ component formed by aortic valve closure is prolonged, resulting in P₂ splitting (D pair).",

        "Explanation": "40-year-old woman with a history of gallbladder stones (which can fall into the bile duct and cause bile duct obstruction). Sudden severe pain in the upper abdomen, most severe on the left side of the mid-abdomen, radiating to the lower back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting (typical clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis), blood amylase 1024 U/L (normal value is about 35-135 U/L , indicating pancreatitis), urinary bilirubin (++) (indicating biliary obstruction). B-ultrasound showed: pancreatic enlargement and peripancreatic leakage (typical B-ultrasound manifestations of pancreatitis). After treatment, the diameter of the common bile duct dropped from 0.9cm to 0.5cm (suggesting possible previous obstruction). In summary, the diagnosis was considered to be biliary pancreatitis, and the most likely cause was the temporary passage of stones through the lower segment of the common bile duct (pair E). Incarceration of gallbladder stones in the gallbladder neck (False A) mainly causes gallbladder effusion or acute cholecystitis, while acute cholecystitis (False D) also does not cause acute pancreatitis under normal circumstances. Duodenal diverticulitis (C error) is mainly caused by mucosal protrusion. The diverticulum wall mainly consists of mucosa, submucosa and serosal layer, but no muscle layer. Most are asymptomatic and have no specific signs. If the diverticulum is located near or within the duodenal papilla, it can cause obstruction and induce biliary tract infection, cholangitis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, etc. Diverticula cannot be eliminated naturally and can only be treated with surgery, which is related to the resolution of biliary obstruction in the middle and late stages of the problem. contradiction. Incarceration of the lower segment of common bile duct stones (B error) can worsen the condition, which is also inconsistent with the resolution of biliary obstruction in the later stages of the problem.",

        "Option E": "Codman triangle is its X-ray characteristic",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Giant cell tumor of bone is more likely to occur in young adults aged 20 to 40 years old (Pair A), with a slight predominance in women. The most common sites are the metaphyses of long bones and vertebral bodies, especially the upper end of the tibia, the lower end of the femur, and the distal end of the radius (Pair B). . Giant cell tumor of bone is a benign tumor, but it is locally aggressive. Some people classify it as a borderline tumor, with a certain possibility of recurrence and metastasis (pair C). Early local thorough excision and curettage plus inactivation is the key to treatment (pair D). The purpose is to completely remove the tumor tissue and remove possible invasive foci at the same time. The typical X-ray manifestations of giant cell tumor of bone are eccentricity, osteolysis, and cystic destruction of the bone end without periosteal reaction. The lesions expand and grow, and the bone cortex becomes thinner, showing soap bubble-like changes. Codman's triangle is the X-ray characteristic of osteosarcoma (E is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). The tumor grows rapidly, pushing up the periosteum, producing new bone under the periosteum, and causing a triangular periosteal reaction, known as Codman's triangle.",

        "Question": "Which of the following statements about intestinal obstruction is correct?",
        "Option A": "Incisional hernia is often the cause of intestinal obstruction",
        "Option B": "The intestinal wall is dark red in color, edematous, thickened, and the intestinal lumen is dilated, indicating that the intestinal tube is lifeless.",
        "Option C": "If the fluid level is not seen on plain abdominal X-ray, the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction can be ruled out.",
        "Option D": "Acute complete obstruction of the colon is a closed loop intestinal obstruction, which can easily cause intestinal strangulation.",
        "Option E": "Intestinal obstruction caused by acute superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, more common in young people",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "For the colon, the ileocecal valve has a one-way valve function, that is, the contents of the colon cannot reflux back into the small intestine. If there is obstruction in the colon segment, a closed intestine with both ends occluded will be formed between the obstructed segment and the ileocecal valve. In the lumen, the tension of the intestinal tube is extremely high, compressing the arteries supplying this section of intestinal tube, causing the blood supply to decrease or even disappear. Therefore, acute complete obstruction of the colon is a closed loop intestinal obstruction, which can easily cause intestinal strangulation (D pair). Incisional hernia is a hernia that occurs at the surgical incision of the abdominal wall. Due to the existence of the incision, the hernia ring of incisional hernia is generally relatively wide, and incarceration rarely affects the movement of intestinal contents. Therefore, incisional hernia generally does not cause intestinal obstruction (A is wrong) ). Dark red color of the intestinal wall, edema, thickening, and dilation of the intestinal lumen only indicate that the intestinal tube has lost activity (False B). If the incarceration is released in time at this time, the intestinal tube can be covered with warm isotonic saline gauze, or the intestinal tube can be temporarily sent back. After being placed in the abdominal cavity for a period of time, the activity of the intestinal tube may be restored; only when the intestinal tube turns purple-black, loses its luster and elasticity, and has no peristalsis after stimulation and no arterial pulsation in the corresponding mesentery, it can be judged as intestinal necrosis. Generally, the air-fluid level is seen on a plain abdominal X-ray (visible in about 50% of patients), which can assist in the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. However, the absence of an air-fluid level does not rule out intestinal obstruction. The obstruction time may be too short and the accumulation of intestinal fluid and gas has not yet occurred ( C is wrong). Small intestinal volvulus is more common in young people, often caused by strenuous exercise after a full meal; intestinal obstruction caused by acute superior mesenteric artery thrombosis is more common in elderly patients with heart disease (E is wrong).",

A week ago, he fell while riding a bicycle and hit the left lower chest wall (suggesting a history of closed injury, consistent with the location of spleen injury). He had been resting in bed for 3 days. (Consider splenic subcapsular rupture), physical examination: P120 times/min (normal value: 60-100 times/min, heart rate is accelerated), R30 times/min (normal value: 12-20 times/min, breathing is accelerated), BP80 /60mmHg (normal values: systolic blood pressure: 90~139mmHg, diastolic blood pressure: 60~89mmHg, consider shock), clear and pale complexion (suggesting shock), subcutaneous ecchymosis can be seen in the left lower chest (suggesting chest wall injury), and the whole abdomen is mild Tenderness and muscle tension (peritoneal irritation sign, indicating visceral rupture and bleeding, but no leakage of bile or pancreatic juice), positive shifting dullness, and disappearance of bowel sounds (indicating a large amount of bleeding). Based on the patient's medical history and clinical manifestations, this condition The patient's most likely diagnosis is splenic rupture (pair A). The main symptoms of splenic rupture are internal bleeding and stimulation of the peritoneum by blood, and are often closely related to the amount and speed of bleeding. The common injury site of liver rupture (B error) is the right upper abdomen or right lower chest wall. When the bile duct is not injured, the clinical manifestations are similar to those of splenic rupture. However, if there is a large intrahepatic bile duct rupture, obvious symptoms may occur due to the strong irritation of bile. Abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation, liver tissue necrosis and decomposition, secondary bacterial infection can form abdominal abscess. Pancreatic rupture (C error) is common when the upper abdomen is squeezed, which can be pressed on the spine and cause rupture. When accompanied by pancreatic duct rupture and pancreatic juice leakage, the clinical manifestations are the same as liver rupture and bile leakage, but there is no one To diagnose pancreatic injury with sufficient accuracy and specificity, the condition must be comprehensively judged through careful medical history, comprehensive physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging tests. Surgical exploration is required when necessary. Hemorrhagic shock may occur when mesenteric tear (D error) causes vascular damage.

        "Explanation": "middle-aged female patient suffers from palpitations, shortness of breath and wakes up at night after progressive exertion (suggesting pulmonary blood reflux disorder). Anteroposterior chest X-ray shows: the left atrium enlarges, the left heart edge straightens, showing a \"pear-shaped heart\" change; a right anterior oblique film shows: the enlarged left atrium compresses the esophagus backward, and the esophagus moves backward, which is typical Changes in plain cardiac X-ray films of mitral valve stenosis. The patient has a history of joint pain (suggesting rheumatoid arthritis). Based on the medical history and typical X-ray findings, rheumatic heart disease is considered for diagnosis (pair B). The X-ray of dilated cardiomyopathy (A error) often shows that the heart shadow is significantly enlarged, especially the left ventricle, and the cardiothoracic ratio is higher than 50%, which is not consistent with the X-ray manifestations of this patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (C error), the shape of the heart does not change significantly, so heart X-rays are often normal.

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The patient, a middle-aged male, progressively worsened his palpitations and shortness of breath after exertion, and had multiple episodes of dyspnea during sleep at night, which needed to be relieved after sitting up. A physical examination revealed that crackles could be heard at the base of both lungs (a common manifestation of left heart failure due to cardiodilation). ). Lower limb edema, jugular vein distention, 2.0cm below the liver rib, hepatic jugular reflux sign (+), lower limb edema (++) (common manifestations of right heart failure due to cardioectasis). P₂>A₂ indicates pulmonary hypertension. Arrhythmia, heart sounds of varying intensity, and short pulse (P88 beats/min, heart rate 110 beats/min) were considered to be atrial fibrillation. The cardiac boundary is enlarged to both sides, the patient's heart is enlarged, and a grade 3/6 systolic wind-like murmur can be heard at the apex of the heart (considering that the cardiac chamber is significantly enlarged due to cardioectasis, resulting in relative mitral regurgitation). In summary, the patient had a long medical history, developed total heart failure, increased heart volume, and was accompanied by symptoms of mitral regurgitation. The diagnosis was considered to be dilated cardiomyopathy plus total heart failure with atrial fibrillation (pair A). A grade 3/6 systolic blowing murmur can be heard at the patient's apex. If mitral regurgitation is considered, the patient's apical pulse should be lifting, and the heart boundary should be expanded to the left and lower, so valvular heart disease is not considered (B error) ). Pericardial effusion (C error) may have signs of systemic circulation congestion such as jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux sign (+), lower limb edema, etc., and the heart boundary expands to both sides, but there is generally no heart murmur and low heart sounds. Blunt and distant. When a large amount of pericardial effusion occurs in a short period of time, it can cause cardiac tamponade, typically manifested by Beck's triad: hypotension, weak heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. Coronary heart disease (error D) often manifests as exertional angina, enlargement of the heart boundary is rare, and there is generally no heart murmur.",

Physical examination: Grade 3/6 systolic blowing murmur at the apex (mitral regurgitation is present, a common underlying disease of infective endocarditis). Laboratory examination showed that the patient's Hb96g/L was mild anemia (normal adult female: 110~150g/L), and the white blood cells were elevated WBC12.8×10⁹/L (normal 4~10×10⁹/L) (consideration of infection) .

        "Option E": "end of atrial systole",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The activity cycle of the ventricle includes systole and diastole. The systole period can be divided into isovolumetric contraction period and ejection period. The ejection period can be divided into rapid ejection period and slowed ejection period. The diastolic period can be divided into isovolumetric contraction period and ejection period. The ventricular filling phase can be divided into rapid filling phase, slow filling phase and atrial systole phase. The ventricular pressure during diastole (which can even form negative pressure and pump blood from the atrium and large veins) is definitely lower than that during systole, so the end of isovolumic diastole, rapid filling period, and atrial systole that are part of diastole are definitely not the highest pressures. . When ventricular contraction increases the intraventricular pressure to exceed the aortic pressure, the semilunar valve opens, the isovolumic contraction period ends, and the rapid ejection period enters. That is, the prerequisite for the isovolumic contraction period to enter the rapid ejection period is that the intraventricular pressure continues to rise, and the rapid ejection period begins. Intraventricular pressure during the ejection phase is greater than during isovolumetric contraction. During the rapid ejection period, the blood in the ventricle quickly enters the aorta, but due to the strong contraction of the ventricular muscle, the ventricular volume shrinks rapidly, and the intraventricular pressure continues to rise, reaching a peak at the end of the rapid ejection period (pair C).",

        "Option D": "CO₂ partial pressure changes",
        "Option E": "capillary blood pressure",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Cerebral blood flow is mainly regulated by two aspects. 1. When the mean arterial pressure changes within the range of 60-140mmHg, the cerebral blood vessels can maintain relatively stable cerebral blood flow through myogenic autoregulation mechanism; 2. The CO₂ partial pressure increases. (D pair) When O₂ partial pressure decreases, cerebral vasodilation occurs and cerebral blood flow increases. As for neural regulation, which plays an important role in the regulation of systemic cardiovascular activity, it has little effect on the regulation of cerebral blood vessels. It is this regulatory characteristic that ensures the blood supply of brain tissue in emergency situations such as human ischemia and hypoxia: During ischemia and hypoxia, under the regulation of cardiovascular reflex activities such as baroreceptor reflex and chemoreceptor reflex, the excitability of sympathetic nerves increases, most of the blood vessels in the human body constrict, the total peripheral resistance increases, and blood pressure rises. Due to the cerebral blood vessel There is no obvious contraction or slight diastole (due to the vasodilation effect of elevated CO₂ partial pressure and hypoxia), which redistributes circulating blood volume, thereby ensuring the preferential supply of cerebral blood flow (coronary blood flow also has a preferential blood supply mechanism) , see 2003N130X’s answer for analysis).",

        "Option E": "tricuspid valve insufficiency",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Afterload refers to the resistance or load encountered by the myocardium after contraction, also known as pressure load. Preload refers to the volume load or pressure experienced by the ventricles during end-diastole. Left ventricular afterload refers to the left ventricular discharge resistance. Aortic stenosis (C pair) and hypertension increase left ventricular afterload. Preload refers to the volume load or pressure load endured by the ventricle at the end of diastole, and is related to the amount of blood returned to the heart by the veins. Mitral stenosis accompanied by pulmonary hypertension (A error) increases right ventricular afterload, causing right ventricular hypertrophy and expansion, eventually leading to right ventricular failure. In mitral valve insufficiency (B error), when the heart contracts, part of the blood flows back from the left ventricle into the left atrium, which increases the capacity load of the left atrium, thereby increasing the capacity load (preload) of the left ventricle. When the aortic valve is insufficient (D error), during diastole, part of the blood flows back into the left ventricle, causing an increase in left ventricular preload. When tricuspid valve insufficiency (E error) occurs, part of the blood flows back from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole, increasing the volume load of the right atrium, thereby increasing the volume load (preload) of the right ventricle.",

At this time, convenient, safe, and non-invasive examination methods should be preferred. B-ultrasound is the first choice for diagnosis. If the condition permits, CT and MRCP can be used to confirm the diagnosis (C pair ), MRCP has the advantages of non-invasiveness and reproducibility, does not require contrast agents, has a high success rate, and can determine the degree and location of common bile duct dilation, as well as whether there is intrahepatic bile duct dilation and whether it is complicated by intrabiliary stones. PTC (wrong D) is an invasive examination that can clearly display the location, scope, and degree of lesions in the intrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. It has certain complications, such as bile leakage, bleeding, and bile duct infection. ERCP (A error) has dual functions of diagnosis and treatment, but it can easily cause bleeding, pancreatitis, etc. The diagnostic function has now been partially replaced by MRCP. For acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis, when the inflammation is controlled, cholangiography It is an indispensable examination, which can be performed by PTC, ERCP or endoscopic ultrasound, etc., which can show the dilation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts, the location and nature of stenosis or obstruction, and determine the cause of intrahepatic bile duct obstruction.

To further confirm the diagnosis, the simplest and most accurate test is MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) (B pair), which is a non-invasive test of the biliary tract. The angiography method can display the obstruction of the upper and lower intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. It has the advantages of non-invasiveness and repeatability.

It does not require the injection of contrast medium and can display the third-level branches of the normal intrahepatic bile duct system. It generally rarely fails. The localization and diagnosis of obstructive jaundice, bile duct stenosis, bile duct injury, intra-abdominal fluid or empyema (such as under the diaphragm), post-biliary anastomosis, intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct stones, and variations in the biliary system all have their own unique features. role.

A week ago, he fell while riding a bicycle and hit the left lower chest wall (suggesting a history of closed injury, consistent with the location of spleen injury). He had been resting in bed for 3 days. (Consider splenic subcapsular rupture), physical examination: P120 times/min (normal value: 60-100 times/min, heart rate is accelerated), R30 times/min (normal value: 12-20 times/min, breathing is accelerated), BP80 /60mmHg (normal systolic blood pressure: 90~139mmHg, diastolic blood pressure: 60~89mmHg, consider shock), clear and pale complexion (suggesting shock), subcutaneous ecchymosis can be seen in the left lower chest (suggesting chest wall injury), mild tenderness and tenderness in the entire abdomen and Muscle tone (peritoneal irritation sign, indicating visceral rupture and bleeding, but no leakage of bile or pancreatic juice), positive shifting dullness, and disappearance of bowel sounds (indicating a large amount of bleeding). Based on the patient's medical history and clinical manifestations, this patient most likely had The possible diagnosis is splenic rupture. The diagnosis is based on the history of trauma and the clinical manifestations of sudden and rapid internal bleeding. To confirm the diagnosis, the preferred emergency examinations are abdominal CT (B pair) and B-ultrasound (it should be noted that ultrasound is closed The preferred examination method for abdominal parenchymal organ damage), which can determine the scope and degree of rupture and provide diagnostic information for hemoperitoneum. Celiac arteriography (A error) is used for abdominal injuries that cannot be confirmed by the above methods. When the solid organ ruptures, arterial contrast agent leakage can be seen. However, this examination is an invasive examination method and has relatively high requirements on equipment and technical conditions. High and expensive, not used as a primary inspection. Abdominal MRI (C error) has a high diagnostic value for vascular injuries and hematomas in certain special parts, such as duodenal intramural hematoma. Plain abdominal X-rays (D error) can detect free air under the diaphragm and changes in the position and size of certain organs. However, if the internal organs in the abdominal cavity have been identified, especially those with shock, they should be treated immediately without further X-rays.

In addition, the patient's heart rate increased (normally 60 to 100 beats/min), the heart rhythm was irregular, P88 beats/min, and the pulse was short and dull, suggesting atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the patient was initially diagnosed as chronic total heart failure with rapid atrial fibrillation. Medications used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. Systolic heart failure accompanied by rapid atrial fibrillation/flutter is the best indication for the use of digitalis, and the patient does not have contraindications to digitalis such as atrioventricular block, so digitalis can be used (pair A). Propafenone (B error) and amiodarone (C error) are both atrial fibrillation cardioversion drugs. However, the patient's arrhythmia has lasted for more than 24 hours and should be treated with anticoagulation for 3 weeks before cardioversion. Direct cardioversion is not suitable. Verapamil (D error) is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that has negative inotropic, negative conduction and negative frequency effects on the heart. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the application of verapamil can facilitate cardioversion when the cardiac function is normal, but when the cardiac function is insufficient, it can aggravate heart failure.",

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "young male patient fell while riding a motorcycle 1 hour ago. On physical examination, BP was 100/60mmHg (blood pressure decreased), heart rate was 100 beats/min (heart rate increased), whole-abdominal tenderness, and obvious rebound tenderness and muscle tension around the umbilicus (peritoneal irritation sign). ), narrowing of the hepatic dullness boundary (a manifestation of perforation of hollow organs such as the duodenum), suspicious shifting dullness (consider peritonitis caused by organ rupture), based on the patient's trauma history, clinical manifestations and signs, the most likely diagnosis is intestinal rupture (D pair). The clinical manifestations of splenic rupture (A error) are mainly characterized by internal bleeding and irritation of the peritoneum by blood. The clinical manifestations are closely related to the amount and speed of bleeding. The abdominal pain initially starts in the upper left part, and gradually affects the whole abdomen, but still focuses on the left upper quadrant. Most obviously, referred pain in the left shoulder may occur due to blood irritation to the diaphragm, and no blood will coagulate during diagnostic abdominal puncture. Liver rupture (B error) manifests as intra-abdominal bleeding and hypovolemic shock. Hemorrhagic peritoneum can cause peritoneal irritation. The clinical manifestations are similar to those of splenic rupture, but because bile may overflow into the abdominal cavity after liver rupture, abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation will occur. It is often more obvious than those with splenic rupture. The main clinical manifestations of pancreatic injury (C error) are internal bleeding and pancreatic peritonitis. If the middle and upper abdomen is squeezed and tenderness occurs in the middle and upper abdomen, especially when the middle and upper abdomen is squeezed on an empty stomach, the possibility of pancreatic injury must be considered. After the pancreas is damaged or ruptured, pancreatic juice can accumulate in the omental sac and manifest as obvious tenderness and muscle tension in the upper abdomen. Shoulder pain can also occur due to stimulation of the diaphragm. Extravasated pancreatic juice can pass through the omental hole or ruptured small intestine. After the omentum enters the abdominal cavity, diffuse peritonitis may occur. Ultrasound and CT can help confirm the diagnosis.",

The patient has jugular vein distension and pitting edema in both lower limbs (symptoms of right heart failure). typical signs). Moreover, the patient's heart rate increased (normally 60 to 100 beats/min), arrhythmia, P88 beats/min, and short pulse (typical manifestations of atrial fibrillation). Therefore, the patient was initially diagnosed as chronic total heart failure with rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient's blood Cr264 μmol/L (normal value: 70-106 μmol/L for women), indicating reduced glomerular filtration function. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ACEI (A is wrong, is the correct answer to this question) can reduce the synthesis of angiotensin II. , which reduces renal perfusion pressure and reduces glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, ACEI should be used with caution in this patient. The patient cannot lie down at night, his lower limbs are edematous, and his jugular veins are distended, suggesting fluid retention. Loop diuretics can be used instead (pair B). The patient's WBC is elevated (normal value 4-10×10⁹/L) and the proportion of neutrophils is elevated (NEUT%, normal adult 40%-75%), indicating that the patient is infected and should be treated with antibiotics (pair C) .

When measuring cardiac function for individuals of different sizes, it is incomplete to use cardiac output as an indicator for comparison. Because short and tall bodies have different levels of oxygen consumption and energy metabolism, cardiac output is also different. Research shows that a person's resting cardiac output, like basal metabolic rate, is not directly proportional to body weight, but to body surface area. The cardiac output calculated per unit body surface area is called the cardiac index, and the cardiac index measured under quiet and fasting conditions is called the resting cardiac index, which can be used as an evaluation index to compare the cardiac function of different individuals (D pair).",

        "Option E": "Persistent dull pain under the sternum, normal abdominal signs",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "After the gastric ulcer is perforated, highly irritating gastric contents enter the abdominal cavity, causing acute abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation. The abdominal wall muscles are stiff and the gas enters the peritoneal cavity, making it impossible to tap the location of the liver dullness boundary. In summary, the typical manifestations of perforated gastric ulcer are epigastric tenderness, rigidity, and disappearance of hepatic dullness (pair C). Right upper quadrant cramping, accompanied by tenderness, jaundice, and positive Murphy's sign (False A) is a typical manifestation of acute cholecystitis with common bile duct stones. Obstruction of bile descent leads to spasmodic contraction of the hepatic duct and cholestasis, which causes jaundice. Acute cholecystitis can cause Gallbladder tenderness and positive Murphy's sign. Pain around the umbilicus, accompanied by tenderness, hyperactive bowel sounds, and intestinal type (B error) is a typical manifestation of acute intestinal obstruction. Due to the obstruction of the downward flow of intestinal contents, intestinal spasm, and hyperactive bowel sounds, pain occurs in the abdomen (visceral pain). It is a dull pain, mostly around the umbilicus), and intestinal type can be seen on inspection of the abdomen. Upper abdominal distension and pain accompanied by stomach shape and slapping sound (D is wrong) are typical manifestations of pyloric obstruction. Food and drinking water cannot pass through the pylorus and stay in the stomach. The stomach is full and distended, and the upper abdomen is distended, painful and vibrating. water sound. Persistent dull pain under the sternum and normal abdominal signs (E wrong) are mostly symptoms of chest diseases, such as angina pectoris.",

Physical examination showed T37°C, P80 times/min, BP130/80mmHg, no jaundice in the skin and sclera, and upper abdominal tenderness (signs of pancreatitis). , no rebound pain and muscle tension (perforation of the digestive tract is not considered for the time being), laboratory tests: blood white blood cells 11×10⁹/L (normal value 4~10×10⁹/L, blood white blood cells are elevated), blood amylase 1000U/ L (35-135U/L, an increase of >3 times is more diagnostic and indicates pancreatitis). Based on the patient's triggers, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis (pair C). To confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, at least two of the following three criteria must be met: ① Abdominal pain symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis; ② Serum amylase and/or lipase > 3 times the upper limit of normal; ③ Consistent with acute pancreatitis The imaging features of this patient meet the first two, and the basis for diagnosis is clear. The typical symptoms of acute cholangitis (False A) are epigastric pain accompanied by high fever, chills, and jaundice (Charcot's triad); acute gastritis (False B) often has causes, such as severe trauma and other stress, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. History of alcohol use, excessive alcohol intake, etc. often manifests as upper abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Severe cases may include hematemesis, melena, dehydration, acidosis, or shock. When making the diagnosis, attention should be paid to clinical manifestations and related symptoms. The cause and inducement can be diagnosed by gastroscopy; upper gastrointestinal perforation (D wrong) is mostly related to taking NSAIDs, and most of them are elderly patients.

On physical examination, BP was 100/60mmHg (blood pressure decreased), heart rate was 100 beats/min (heart rate increased), whole-abdominal tenderness, and obvious rebound tenderness and muscle tension around the umbilicus (peritoneal irritation sign). ), narrowing of the hepatic dullness boundary (a manifestation of perforation of hollow organs such as the duodenum), suspicious shifting dullness (consider peritonitis caused by organ rupture), based on the patient's trauma history, clinical manifestations and signs, the most likely diagnosis is intestinal rupture , whether it is an injured abdominal organ or secondary peritonitis caused by injury, diagnostic abdominal puncture is an important method to confirm the diagnosis, especially when the symptoms and signs of this patient clearly point to intestinal rupture, at this time, it is the most important to make a clear diagnosis. The examination is abdominal puncture (D). Digestive juice or bloody fluid can be seen in the puncture. In clinical practice, abdominal puncture and fluid extraction are mostly performed under ultrasound guidance, which is highly accurate. Ultrasound (C), as a simple, economical, fast and intuitive non-invasive examination method, is the preferred examination method for closed substantial abdominal injuries. It is mainly used for liver, spleen, kidney and upper abdominal trauma, but it is not suitable for hollow organs. The diagnosis is not sensitive enough. If there is fluid accumulation around the hollow organs, abdominal puncture under ultrasound guidance can help the diagnosis. The question stem of this example is stated as \"The first inspection is\". Based on the above, the official standard answer is C. Serum amylase may be elevated in intestinal rupture, but the diagnosis of intestinal rupture is not specific (False A). When the pancreas is injured, amylase in the blood and urine is elevated. Abdominal MRI (B error) has a high diagnostic value for vascular injuries and hematomas in certain special parts, such as duodenal intramural hematoma.

After self-administering nitroglycerin due to chest tightness, the dizziness worsened and a brief amaurosis occurred. A grade 3/6 systolic blowing murmur could be heard in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal edge (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Common murmur), A₂ weakened, small heart boundary, no signs of heart failure, and his father had a similar medical history (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant inheritance), suggesting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (A pair). The most common symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are exertional dyspnea and fatigue. About 1/3 of patients may have exertional chest pain. Some patients have syncope, which often occurs during exercise. A systolic murmur can be heard at the apex of the heart. This is Because the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve moves toward the interventricular septum, resulting in mitral valve insufficiency, patients with outflow tract obstruction may hear a coarse ejection systolic murmur in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal border. Dilated cardiomyopathy (B error) is characterized by left ventricular or biventricular enlargement accompanied by systolic dysfunction. The main clinical manifestations are dyspnea during activity and decreased activity tolerance. The main signs are enlargement of the heart boundary and weakened heart sounds on auscultation, which can often reach the third The third or fourth heart sound is a galloping rhythm when the heart rate is fast. Although some congenital heart diseases (C error) such as ventricular septal defect can also hear systolic murmur in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space on the left sternal edge, the age of onset is mostly earlier, often in childhood, which is inconsistent with this case. Ischemic heart disease (wrong D) often causes pain in the precordial area during emotional agitation and exertion. Symptoms should be relieved after taking nitroglycerin.",

        "Option E": "K⁺ outflow",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Phase 3 repolarization of ventricular myocytes is caused by the inactivation and closure of L-type calcium channels in phase 2, weakening the inward ion flow, and further increasing the K⁺ outflow mediated by Ik channels (E pair). By the end of phase 3, as the membrane As the negative value of the potential increases, the K⁺ outflow mediated by the Ik₁ channel also increases, which further accelerates the repolarization process. This regenerative cycle makes the third-stage repolarization faster and faster until the repolarization is completed.",

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The amount of blood ejected by one side of the ventricle in one heartbeat is called stroke volume, or stroke volume for short. The percentage of stroke volume in the end-diastolic volume of the ventricle is called ejection fraction. Under normal circumstances, due to heterometric regulation, stroke volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume are compatible, that is, when ventricular end-diastolic volume increases, stroke volume also increases accordingly, while ejection fraction remains basically unchanged. In patients with ventricular dysfunction and abnormal ventricular enlargement, the stroke volume may not be significantly different from that of normal people, but it is not compatible with the increased end-diastolic volume. In fact, the ejection fraction has significantly decreased. Therefore, compared with stroke volume, ejection fraction can more accurately reflect cardiac pumping function and is of great significance for early detection of abnormal cardiac pumping function (pair C).",

        "Option E": "Persistent dull pain under the sternum, normal abdominal signs",
        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "In patients with acute intestinal obstruction, due to obstruction of the downward flow of intestinal contents, intestinal spasm, and hyperactive bowel sounds, pain occurs in the abdomen (visceral pain is a dull pain, mostly around the umbilicus). Intestinal patterns can be seen on inspection of the abdomen, and during palpation There may be tenderness due to intestinal distension. In summary, acute intestinal obstruction manifests as pain around the umbilicus, accompanied by tenderness, hyperactive bowel sounds, and intestinal type (B pair). Right upper quadrant cramping, accompanied by tenderness, jaundice, and positive Murphy's sign (False A) is a typical manifestation of acute cholecystitis with common bile duct stones. Obstruction of bile descent leads to spasmodic contraction of the hepatic duct and cholestasis, which causes jaundice. Acute cholecystitis can cause Gallbladder tenderness and positive Murphy's sign. Upper abdominal tenderness, rigidity, and disappearance of liver dullness (C error) are typical manifestations of gastric ulcer perforation. After perforation, highly irritating gastric contents enter the abdominal cavity, causing acute abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation, and abdominal wall muscle rigidity. Because gas enters the peritoneal cavity, the location of the dullness boundary in the liver cannot be cleared by percussion. Upper abdominal distension and pain accompanied by stomach shape and slapping sound (D is wrong) are typical manifestations of pyloric obstruction. Food and drinking water cannot pass through the pylorus and stay in the stomach. The stomach is full and distended, and the upper abdomen is distended, painful and vibrating. Water sound. Persistent dull pain under the sternum and normal abdominal signs (E wrong) are mostly symptoms of chest diseases, such as angina pectoris.",

        "Explanation": "The elderly patient had sudden precordial pain, which continued to worsen with paroxysmal episodes. He sweated and was not relieved by taking nitroglycerin in the mouth. He had a history of hypertension and diabetes. The electrocardiogram showed QS waves in leads V₁~V₅, and the ST segment was arched upward. Elevated, acute myocardial infarction can be diagnosed. Troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) increases 3 to 4 hours after the onset of illness, cTnI reaches a peak at 11 to 24 hours, and drops to normal in 7 to 10 days, and cTnT reaches a peak at 24 to 48 hours, and reaches a peak at 10 ~14 days to return to normal. Troponin measurement has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing myocardial damage, and has a low false positive rate. In this case, the troponin had not dropped to normal for about 8 hours after acute myocardial infarction, so troponin (C pair) Determination is the most valuable indicator for diagnosing myocardial damage. Creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) (False A) is less sensitive and specific than troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) (False A). D-dimer (B-dimer) is mainly used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "ALT, alanine aminotransferase, is mainly distributed in the liver, followed by skeletal muscle, kidney, myocardium and other tissues. Hepatic hemangioma (D pair) is a benign tumor, mostly cavernous hemangioma. It grows slowly, does not damage liver cells, does not cause an increase in ALT, and does not cause changes in the biochemical functions of the liver. In viral hepatitis (False A), liver cells undergo massive necrosis and release ALT, causing blood ALT to rise. Suppurative cholangitis (P445) (B error) and acute cholecystitis (P443) (C error) are biliary tract diseases. The inflammatory reaction spreads to the liver, or the infection travels retrograde to the liver through the biliary tract, which can cause liver enzymes including ALT. rise. The content of ALT is also high in myocardial cells. When myocardial cells are damaged during myocardial infarction (E error), it can be released, causing blood ALT to increase.",

The clinical manifestations of output loop obstruction (C error) include upper abdominal distension and vomiting containing bile gastric contents, which are often caused by postoperative intestinal adhesions or mesenteric compression of the intestinal tube behind the colon. Surgical treatment should be performed according to the clinical situation to relieve the cause. Dumping syndrome (False A) is a series of clinical symptoms caused by the loss of the pyloric control function of the stomach after subtotal gastrectomy, resulting in excessive emptying of gastric contents. It is divided into early dumping syndrome and late dumping syndrome (low-dumping syndrome). Blood glucose syndrome), the former usually occurs within 30 minutes after eating, and is manifested by upper abdominal fullness and discomfort, diarrhea, palpitations, fatigue, sweating, dizziness, fainting, sweating, pale complexion, deep breathing, etc.; the latter often It appears 2 to 4 hours after eating and manifests as palpitation, sweating, dizziness, weakness, paleness, and hand tremors. Postoperative gastroparesis (D error) is a syndrome mainly caused by gastric emptying disorder after gastric surgery. It usually occurs 2 to 3 days after surgery. It mostly occurs when the diet is changed from fasting to liquid or liquid to semi-liquid. , the clinical manifestations are nausea and vomiting, and the vomitus is mostly green. At this time, gastrointestinal decompression is required.

Pulmonary valve insufficiency (B error) is a diastolic murmur heard on auscultation in the second intercostal space on the left sternal border. Its nature is similar to aortic valve insufficiency, but the pitch is lower than the latter. The typical murmur of mitral regurgitation (C error) is a holosystolic blowing murmur in the apical region, which may be accompanied by systolic tremor. Tricuspid regurgitation (D error) is auscultated as a holosystolic murmur in the 4th to 5th intercostal space on the left sternal border, which may occasionally be loudest in the xiphoid process area. When the right ventricle is significantly enlarged and the heart is transposed, the murmur may be located in the apex area. .",

Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed enlargement of the pancreas, uneven density, blurred borders, mild leakage around the pancreas, and low-density plaques in the body and tail of the pancreas (typical imaging of pancreatitis) performance), consider that the patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Since acute necrotizing pancreatitis has fat necrosis in the surrounding tissue and calcium soap formation in the fat, which consumes calcium, the decrease in blood calcium level also represents the degree of pancreatic necrosis, and the decrease in blood calcium It often occurs 2 to 3 days after the onset of the disease. If the blood calcium level drops significantly and remains below 2.0mmol/L (pair B), it often indicates a serious illness (Page 1634 of Huang Jiasi Surgery, 8th edition). There is no positive correlation between the increase in blood urinary amylase and serum lipase and the severity of the disease (AD is wrong). The early increase in blood sugar is a stress response of the adrenal cortex, which is generally mild.

        "Explanation": "Commonly used drug treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease include gastrointestinal motility drugs, acid-suppressing drugs, and antacids. Acid suppression is the main measure currently used to treat this disease. Acid-suppressing drugs include H₂RAs and PPIs (such as omeprazole).

        "Option E": "peritoneal fluid amylase",
        "Correct Answer": "E",
        "Explanation": "Based on \"sudden epigastric pain for 8 hours\", it was determined that an acute abdomen had occurred; the patient's peritoneal irritation sign was positive throughout the entire abdomen, with the epigastrium being the most severe, and it could be inferred that a certain organ in the upper abdomen (liver, spleen, stomach, intestine, pancreas) was the primary cause of the disease. lesions. If it is a liver rupture, the abdominal puncture fluid should contain bile; if it is a spleen rupture, there will be no obvious signs of irritation throughout the abdomen due to weak irritation of the blood; and the liver and spleen usually do not rupture spontaneously and are mostly caused by external forces; Gastric perforation can cause symptoms of weight loss, but the puncture fluid should contain gastric juice and food residues; if the intestinal tract is ruptured, the abdominal puncture fluid should contain food residues or feces. After excluding the above diseases, the patient can be judged to have acute severe pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis, the most valuable diagnostic test is blood amylase measurement. There is no such answer. The patient had shifting dullness (+) and bloody fluid was extracted by abdominal puncture, so amylase measurement in the abdominal puncture fluid is the most valuable for diagnosis (pair E). MRI (C error) and ERCP (D error) are not very helpful in diagnosis and are intolerable to patients. Although B-ultrasound (A error) is helpful for diagnosis, its value is not as good as amylase measurement in abdominal puncture fluid. Note: Although the imaging examination with the most diagnostic value for acute pancreatitis is enhanced CT, the best answer to this question cannot be B because the patient has already extracted bloody fluid through abdominal puncture and is in shock. Clinically, the simplest and most effective method should be used. The method is to confirm the diagnosis as soon as possible, and send the abdominal puncture fluid to check for amylase.",

        "Explanation": "Heart failure complicated by dilated cardiomyopathy (pair A) is mostly congestive heart failure. Using digitalis and diuretics together with β-blockers can not only control heart failure, but also prolong the survival time of patients. , reduce disability and hospitalization rates, and improve exercise tolerance. Rheumatic bistenosis (B error) is accompanied by heart failure, and rheumatic fever is the main cause, so the cause must be treated. Mitral valve stenosis can also be complicated by infective endocarditis, so precautions must be taken. If heart failure occurs in viral myocarditis (C wrong), it usually indicates a wide range of inflammation and serious condition. Diuretics, vasodilators, ACEI, etc. can be used as appropriate. Pulmonary heart disease combined with heart failure (D error) is generally caused by respiratory system infection and other reasons, so the first choice treatment should be to control infection and improve ventilation. Digitalis is the first choice for systolic heart failure accompanied by rapid atrial fibrillation (E error) and atrial flutter.",

        "Explanation": "The main function of nitrates (pair A) is to relieve pain by increasing coronary blood flow and reducing ventricular preload, and has no impact on the survival rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The combination of calcium channel blockers (β-blockers) and beta-blockers or both and nitrates can effectively reduce chest pain, reduce the risk of near-term death, and reduce the need for acute myocardial infarction and emergency coronary surgery. . Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (C error) help improve myocardial remodeling during recovery and reduce the mortality rate of MI and the occurrence of congestive heart failure. β-receptor antagonists (D) can reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and improve the oxygen supply and demand imbalance in the ischemic area, reduce the MI area, and reduce the incidence of recurrent myocardial ischemia, reinfarction, ventricular fibrillation and other malignant arrhythmias. It has a certain effect on reducing the mortality rate in the acute phase and can reduce morbidity and mortality.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The repolarization process of ventricular myocardium is relatively slow, including three stages of action potential: phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. Phase 1 is also called the early stage of rapid repolarization. In this phase, only partial repolarization occurs, and the intramembrane potential rapidly changes from +30mV to +30mV. Drops to about 0mV, and enters phase 2 after the end of phase 1 repolarization. The repolarization process in phase 2 begins to become very slow, and the recorded action potential pattern is relatively flat, also known as the plateau phase. The plateau phase is the action of ventricular myocytes. The main reason for the long duration of the potential is also the main feature that distinguishes it from the action potential of nerve cells and skeletal muscle cells (pair C).",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Young and middle-aged male patients (chronic glomerulonephritis is the main group), with intermittent edema of both lower limbs and proteinuria for 10 years (chronic process), symptoms of fatigue, anorexia, nausea and bleeding (suggesting decreased renal function), blood pressure 150/ 90mmHg, blood Hb80g/L (normal adult male Hb120g/L~160g/L, anemia usually indicates a chronic disease process), proteinuria (++). All the above suggest that the patient's most likely diagnosis is chronic glomerulonephritis and renal failure. The blood creatinine in the laboratory test is 707 μmol/L, which meets the criteria for the uremic stage of chronic renal failure (serum creatinine ≥707 μmol/L). Therefore, the patient's blood creatinine is 707 μmol/L. The most likely cause of elevated creatinine is chronic glomerulonephritis (pair A). The two necessary diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome (B error) are: ① proteinuria greater than 3.5g/d (qualitative test should be +++~++++); ② plasma albumin less than 30g/L (P470). In this case, the urine protein (++) did not meet the nephrotic syndrome urine protein standard and there was no mention of hypoalbuminemia, so nephrotic syndrome was ruled out. Hypertensive renal damage (C error) requires a long history of hypertension and rarely occurs proteinuria. Decreased renal function first begins with a decrease in renal tubular concentrating function (P250). This patient had no history of hypertension, and his blood pressure was only 150/90mmHg and proteinuria (++) on admission, so hypertension and renal damage were ruled out.

The incidence of spinal tuberculosis accounts for about 50% of bone and joint tuberculosis, and most of them occur in the vertebral body (E pair). Marginal vertebral tuberculosis is more common in adults, with the lumbar spine being the most common site (pair B). The disease is limited to the upper and lower edges of the vertebral body and quickly invades the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral bodies. Central vertebral body is more common in children under 10 years old. It occurs most frequently in the thoracic spine (C pair).

Short-term treatment can lead to pulmonary edema and In cardiogenic shock, long-term use will worsen cardiac function and increase the risk of death. Amlodipine or felodipine can only be used in patients with chronic heart failure combined with severe hypertension or angina pectoris that cannot be controlled by other drugs.

In addition, during inspiration, the pulmonary vascular bed expands, pulmonary venous blood flow decreases, and left ventricular filling volume further decreases, resulting in reduced systolic reflux, so the systolic murmur in the apical auscultation area is weakened (pair A). In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the third heart sound (B pair) and a brief diastolic rumble-like murmur can be heard in the apical area. Excessive filling during ventricular diastole causes the mitral valve to float, resulting in a higher position of the mitral valve before ventricular systole, smaller amplitude when closed, and weakened first heart sound (pair C).

Proglutamide (A) is a gastrin receptor blocking drug. It competes with gastrin for gastrin receptors and inhibits gastric acid secretion. It also promotes gastric mucosal mucus synthesis and enhances gastric mucosal mucus-bicarbonate production. The salt protects the barrier and thus exerts an anti-ulcer effect. Derivatives of prostaglandin E₂ (B') are gastric mucosal protective agents. For example, misoprostol can inhibit gastric acid secretion, increase mucus and bicarbonate secretion in the gastroduodenal mucosa, and increase mucosal blood flow. It is mainly used for For NSAID ulcer prevention. Piperazepine (D error) is a selective anti-M cholinergic drug that competitively inhibits acetylcholine and has a high affinity for M₁ receptors in the gastric mucosa (especially parietal cells). At normal doses, it only inhibits gastric acid secretion but does not affect smooth muscle. , cardiac muscle and salivary glands have low M₂ receptor affinity. Mortidine (E) is a gastrointestinal motility drug and a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist.

        "Explanation": "Coagulation time (CT) refers to the time it takes for blood to leave the blood vessel and coagulate outside the body. It reflects the function of the endogenous coagulation system and has nothing to do with platelets. Therefore, CT in ITP patients is normal; platelets participate in the contraction of blood clots, and thrombocytopenia is seen in ITP patients. Poor blood clot contraction (A is wrong). Bleeding time (BT) refers to the time required from the natural outflow of blood to the natural stop after artificially puncturing skin capillaries. It is affected by the quantity and quality of platelets, capillary structure and function. ITP patients have reduced platelets, so the bleeding time It will be prolonged; the average platelet volume in ITP patients is larger (B pair). About 70% of patients are positive for anti-platelet autoantibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies and antinuclear antibodies can be detected in some patients (pair C). In patients with ITP, due to thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow megakaryocytic system may undergo compensatory proliferation, the number of megakaryocytes is normal or increased, and the number of plate-forming megakaryocytes is reduced (D is wrong).

For example, misoprostol can inhibit gastric acid secretion, increase mucus and bicarbonate secretion in the gastroduodenal mucosa, and increase mucosal blood flow. It is mainly used for For NSAID ulcer prevention. Proglutamide (A) is a gastrin receptor blocking drug. It competes with gastrin for gastrin receptors and inhibits gastric acid secretion. It also promotes gastric mucosal mucus synthesis and enhances gastric mucosal mucus-bicarbonate production. The salt protects the barrier and thus exerts an anti-ulcer effect. Omeprazole (C-P) is a proton pump inhibitor that inactivates H⁺-K⁺-ATPase. It has a strong acid-suppressing effect and can achieve an acid-free level in the stomach. Piperazepine (D error) is a selective anti-M cholinergic drug that competitively inhibits acetylcholine at the M receptor site. It has a high affinity for the M₁ receptor of the gastric mucosa (especially parietal cells). At normal doses, it only Inhibits gastric acid secretion and has low affinity for M₂ receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and salivary glands. Mortidine (E) is a gastrointestinal motility drug and a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist. It can promote the peristalsis and tension of the upper gastrointestinal tract to return to normal, promote gastric emptying, and increase gastric antrum and duodenal intestinal motility. Coordinates the contraction of the pylorus, while also enhancing the peristalsis of the esophagus and the tension of the lower esophageal sphincter.",

Aldosterone has the function of retaining sodium, water, and potassium. Sodium and water retention can cause water and sodium retention, causing high blood pressure. Increased potassium excretion can lead to hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypokalemic alkalosis. Therefore, the characteristics of PA are hypokalemia + hypertension. The patient in this case has high blood pressure (hypertension: systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg), hypokalemia on the electrocardiogram (low potassium is the appearance of U wave; high potassium is the peak of T wave), and there are other symptoms of hypokalemia.

        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Coronary heart disease (P218) is a heart disease caused by coronary atherosclerosis that causes lumen stenosis or occlusion, leading to myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, or necrosis. It is also called ischemic heart disease. Ventricular and coronary angiography (pair C) can directly understand the shape and blockage of the coronary arteries, and is currently the most valuable examination for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Echocardiography (A error) includes M-mode ultrasound, two-dimensional ultrasound, pulse Doppler, continuous Doppler, and color Doppler blood flow imaging. It is a non-invasive technology of choice for examining the anatomical structure and functional status of the heart and great blood vessels. It is also an auxiliary diagnosis for cardiac tumors, coronary heart disease, pericardial disease, hypertensive heart disease, pulmonary heart disease, artificial valve follow-up, and large vessel disease. value. X-ray cardiac three-dimensional photo examination (B error) refers to observing the heart from three directions: posteroanterior, right anterior oblique, and left anterior oblique (some patients may also take a left lateral view when necessary). The size and shape of large blood vessels and changes in pulmonary blood. Floating catheter examination (D error) can measure the cardiac index (CI) and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PCWP), which directly reflects the left ventricular function, so it is most valuable for judging the left ventricular function. Electrocardiogram exercise test, also called electrocardiogram exercise stress test (ECG), is to increase the load on the heart through a certain amount of exercise and observe changes in electrocardiogram. It is used to test patients with known or suspected cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. (coronary heart disease) Methods of conducting clinical assessments.",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Patients with aortic stenosis have increased left ventricular ejection resistance, compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, and significantly enhanced left ventricular contractility, so a lifting pulse can be palpated at the apex (pair A). Precordial lifting pulses (B fault) are common in patients with ventricular septal defects. In ventricular septal defect, left-to-right shunt occurs, right ventricular pressure load increases, right ventricular volume increases, right ventricular hypertrophy causes clockwise rotation of the heart, precordial area is occupied, and precordial lifting pulse occurs. Abnormal pulsation at the base of the heart (C error) on the left edge of the sternum is common in pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary artery dilation, or when young people are emotional, and on the right sternum is common in ascending aorta dilatation and aortic hypertension. Suprasternal fossa lifting pulsation (D error) can be seen in ascending aortic aneurysm. It is caused by the compression and erosion of the sternum by the tumor body. Therefore, there may be a local bulge and obvious pulsation in the 1st and 2nd intercostal space of the right anterior chest, or in the suprasternal fossa. A pulsatile mass is palpated. Abnormal pulsation in the right neck (E error) is mostly abnormal pulsation of the carotid artery. It is seen in diseases with increased pulse pressure, such as aortic valve insufficiency, hypertension, hyperthyroidism and severe anemia. It can also be seen in carotid aneurysm.",

When exogenous glucocorticoids are given When the pituitary gland secretes ACTH, the secretion of cortisol decreases. Ectopic ACTH syndrome occurs when tissues other than the pituitary gland secrete large amounts of ACTH or ACTH analogues, stimulating the adrenal cortex to hyperplasia, causing it to secrete excess cortisol, mineralocorticoids, and sex hormones, causing a series of symptoms and causing tumors of ectopic ACTH syndrome ( The most common is lung cancer, followed by thymoma, thymic carcinoid, pancreatic islet tumor, bronchial carcinoid, etc.) are generally autonomous and are not excited by CRH or inhibited by glucocorticoids, that is, the syndrome does not involve the hypothalamus. - Regulation of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis, so it cannot be inhibited by the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test; however, it should be noted that the secretion of ACTH by bronchial carcinoids is special (i.e., ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by bronchial carcinoids), and most of them can It is suppressed by the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, so a small number of patients can be suppressed during the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test and are seen in ectopic ACTH syndrome (E pair).

A large number of facts show that during the communication process between doctors and patients, any party's disrespect or infringement of the rights of the other party is one of the important causes of doctor-patient disputes. In particular, medical personnel must face doctors and patients fairly. Disputes require facts and we must handle such issues from a fair standpoint. Hospitals/doctors must uphold the principles of mutual respect, equal collaboration, scientific practice of medicine, patient-centeredness, people-oriented, and abide by laws and regulations. They must be based on facts, use the law as the criterion, proceed from medical science, and proceed from the interests of patients and be reasonable.

Physical examination: upper abdominal distension, tenderness, mild muscle tension and rebound tenderness (suggesting mild peritoneal irritation), and weak bowel sounds (suggesting paralytic ileus). Laboratory tests: WBC 16.7×10⁹/L, blood amylase 786U/dL, urine amylase 1600U/dL (amylase measurement value is much greater than 500U/dL, indicating acute pancreatitis).

To confirm the diagnosis, the most effective examination method is abdominal CT (pair B). It can not only diagnose acute pancreatitis, but also identify whether it is accompanied by pancreatic tissue necrosis. Pancreatic necrosis can be diagnosed when there are areas of heterogeneous texture, liquefaction, and honeycomb-like low-density on a background of diffuse pancreatic enlargement. In severe pancreatitis, saponified plaques may be formed, and calcification points can be seen on abdominal X-rays (A), but they cannot be used as a basis for diagnosis.

        "Explanation": "Currently, the best treatment option for this patient is anti-infection. A body temperature exceeding 38.5°C indicates severe intra-abdominal infection, requiring surgical removal of necrotic tissue and drainage (pair C). Fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, fluid rehydration and analgesia (A is wrong) are one of the general symptomatic treatments for acute pancreatitis. Early surgical treatment is not recommended for acute pancreatitis (False B). In the early stages of inflammation, the pancreatic tissue is severely necrotic and the boundaries with surrounding tissues are unclear. Surgery not only cannot prevent the progression of the disease, but can also cause the spread of infection. Peritoneal lavage (False D) can be used to treat diffuse purulent peritonitis to remove pus from the abdominal cavity and reduce adhesions.",

Two days ago, I suddenly developed persistent epigastric pain, which became more severe, accompanied by pain in the lower back, nausea, and vomiting (common clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis). Physical examination: upper abdominal distension, tenderness, mild muscle tension and rebound tenderness (suggesting mild peritoneal irritation), and weak bowel sounds (suggesting paralytic ileus). Laboratory tests: WBC 16.7×10⁹/L, blood amylase 786U/dl, urine amylase 1600U/dl (amylase measured value is much greater than 500U/dl, indicating acute pancreatitis). Based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, the diagnosis was acute pancreatitis (pair A). Acute cholangitis (B error) often presents with jaundice, severe percussion pain in the liver area, and high fever. Acute cholecystitis (C wrong) is characterized by right upper quadrant pain, obvious right upper quadrant tenderness, and mild elevation of amylase.

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Whipple surgery is pancreaticoduodenectomy, which is mainly used to treat pancreatic head cancer. The scope of resection includes the head of the pancreas (including the uncinate process), distal stomach, duodenum, upper jejunum, gallbladder and common bile duct. The corresponding regional lymph nodes need to be removed at the same time. After resection, the pancreas, common hepatic duct, stomach and jejunum are reconstructed. A 70-year-old man who underwent Whipple surgery 1 year ago (postoperative anastomotic stenosis may occur and there are susceptibility factors) has had recurrent fever with chills for 2 months, with a maximum body temperature of 39.5 degrees, WBC 15×10⁹/L (symptoms of infection and poisoning) Obviously), serum ALT121U/L (normal value is less than 40 U/L), Tbil58μmol/L (normal value does not exceed 17.1μmol/L) (liver function damage exists), CT shows multiple low-density lesions in the liver with a diameter of 1 to 2cm, The edges were significantly enhanced (a typical CT finding of bacterial liver abscess), and the diagnosis was considered to be multiple liver abscesses (pair D). Liver metastatic cancer (P420) (A wrong) often has clinical manifestations of extrahepatic primary tumors. When the metastases are large, discomfort and pain in the upper abdomen or liver area may occur. Symptoms of acute infection and poisoning such as high fever and chills are generally not present. CT It also appears as a solid lesion, and the overall CT value of metastases increases significantly when enhanced. Acute cholangitis (P440) (B error) is typically characterized by Charcot's triad, namely abdominal pain, jaundice, chills and high fever. Low-density lesions with obvious edge enhancement on intrahepatic CT scans are generally not present. Acute hepatitis (C error) is mostly caused by hepatitis virus and typically manifests as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, jaundice and other symptoms of decreased liver function. It generally does not lead to a significant increase in peripheral blood white blood cells.",

Physical examination: body temperature 37.5°C, tenderness in the middle of the lower abdomen, mild muscle tension, and active bowel sounds. The blood test showed WBC12.5×10⁹/L, and the stool routine WBC2~4. The abdominal X-ray showed no free air under the diaphragm, and several air-fluid levels were seen in the middle and lower abdomen.

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The patient experienced abdominal pain first in the epigastrium and then around the umbilicus, which is typical metastatic abdominal pain. The patient has tenderness in the middle of the lower abdomen and mild muscle tension, indicating fixed point tenderness; tenderness in the non-right lower abdomen is determined by individual differences in the position of the appendix, and the diagnosis of acute appendicitis cannot be ruled out based on this. Coupled with symptoms such as elevated blood count, gastrointestinal irritation symptoms, and increased leukocytosis in stool routine, acute appendicitis was the most likely diagnosis in this case. Although the air-fluid level may appear in intestinal obstruction (error A), this patient does not have the typical symptoms of intestinal obstruction such as stopping exhaust and defecation, so this reason is not considered. When intestinal paralysis (C error) causes paralytic intestinal obstruction, the air-fluid level may appear, but the patient's bowel sounds are active, which can rule out the possibility of intestinal paralysis. Pelvic inflammatory stimulation (D wrong) is mainly manifested by increased stool frequency, tenesmus, etc. Generally, the air-liquid level does not appear. Regarding whether diarrhea can cause air-liquid level, the ninth edition of the textbook does not clearly state that it may be because there is a certain amount of gas in the patient's intestines and diarrhea occurs, and the loose stool becomes the liquid part of the X-ray film, so the air-liquid level may appear (B right).",

It can not only diagnose pancreatitis, but also identify whether it is accompanied by pancreatic tissue necrosis and the extent and extent of necrosis. It can be used to assist in the diagnosis of mild and severe pancreatitis. Pancreatic necrosis can be diagnosed when uneven texture, liquefaction, and honeycomb-like low-density areas appear on the background of diffuse pancreatic enlargement. It also has diagnostic value for its complications such as pancreatic abscess and pseudocyst. Abdominal B-ultrasound (A error) is simple and easy to perform, but the accuracy may be affected due to the interference of gastrointestinal gas in the upper abdomen. Serum calcium measurement (C error) can indicate whether severe pancreatitis is present. It is generally believed that a decrease in serum calcium (<1.87mmol/L) supports the diagnosis of severe pancreatitis, but its specificity is poor compared to contrast-enhanced CT. Blood and urine amylase measurement (D error) is the most commonly used method for diagnosing pancreatitis. The higher the amylase value, the higher the accuracy of diagnosis.

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Postoperative dyspnea and asphyxia are the most critical postoperative complications. Most occur within 48 hours after surgery. Two hours after returning to the ward, the patient felt short of breath, palpitation, and cyanotic, which were symptoms of dyspnea. Furthermore, since the wound was full and the tension was high, it is not difficult to speculate that the wound was bleeding and compressing the trachea (pair A), causing dyspnea. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (B error) contains motor nerve fibers that control the vocal cords. Injury to one side of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can cause hoarseness. Injury to both sides of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can cause difficulty breathing or even suffocation, but the wound will not be full and the tension will be high; Dyspnea caused by recurrent nerve injury usually occurs during surgery. Superior laryngeal nerve injury (C error) If the outer branch is injured, the cricothyroid muscle will be paralyzed, causing the vocal cords to relax and the tone to decrease; if the inner branch is injured, the mucosal sensation in the larynx will be lost. When eating, especially drinking, it is easy to accidentally swallow and cause choking. Generally does not cause difficulty breathing. When the parathyroid gland is injured (D error), PTH secretion decreases and blood calcium concentration decreases, which can cause pinprick-like numbness or stiffness on the face, lips, hands and feet. In severe cases, facial muscles and hands and feet may be accompanied by pain. Sustained spasms occur multiple times a day, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes or longer. In severe cases, spasms of the larynx and diaphragm may occur, causing suffocation. However, the patient has no symptoms such as spasms and twitches, so parathyroid damage is not considered.",

        "Question": "The main factors leading to an increase in diastolic blood pressure are",

        "Option B": "increased cardiac output",
        "Option C": "Sclerosis of the aorta and large arteries",
        "Option D": "Increased circulating blood volume",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The level of diastolic blood pressure mainly reflects the size of peripheral resistance. When peripheral resistance increases, the speed of blood outflow during diastole of the heart slows down, and diastolic blood pressure increases significantly (pair A). During the systole of the heart, the increase in arterial blood pressure causes the blood to The flow rate increases, causing the increase in systolic blood pressure to be less pronounced than the increase in diastolic blood pressure. Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. When cardiac output increases, it may be an increase in stroke volume or an increase in heart rate within a certain range. Changes in stroke volume mainly affect systolic blood pressure. When stroke volume increases, the amount of blood injected into the aorta during systole increases, and the pressure on the arterial wall also increases, so systolic blood pressure increases significantly. As arterial blood pressure increases, blood flow velocity increases, the amount of blood remaining in the aorta at the end of diastole does not increase much, and the increase in diastolic blood pressure is relatively small. When the heart rate increases, the ventricular diastolic period is significantly shortened, the blood volume flowing from the aorta to the periphery during diastole decreases, and the blood volume retained in the aorta increases, resulting in a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure. Due to the blood volume retained in the aorta at the end of diastole, Increase, the blood volume in the aorta increases during systole, and the systolic blood pressure also increases accordingly. However, because the increase in blood pressure accelerates the blood flow speed, more blood flows to the periphery during systole, causing the systolic blood pressure to increase to a smaller extent. . Therefore, the increase in cardiac output caused by an increase in heart rate mainly affects the increase in diastolic blood pressure. Option B is controversial. When the aorta and large arteries harden, the elastic fibers in the wall of the tubes decrease and the collagen fibers increase. The elastic reservoir function of the large arteries is weakened, and the buffering effect on blood pressure is weakened. Therefore, the systolic blood pressure increases and the diastolic blood pressure decreases (C is wrong). Circulating blood volume mainly affects the average filling pressure (D error) of the circulatory system, and the average filling pressure is an important prerequisite for the formation of blood pressure.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Positive Perthes test: Also known as the deep vein patency test, it mainly checks whether the deep veins of the lower limbs are patent. The specific operation is for the patient to stand, tie a tourniquet on 1/3 of the upper thigh of the affected limb to block the saphenous vein's centripetal return, and then instruct the patient to alternately extend and flex the knee joint 10 to 20 times to promote the return of blood from the lower limbs from the deep venous system. If the superficial varicose veins are significantly reduced or disappear, it means that the deep veins are unobstructed; if the varicose veins are not reduced or even worsened, it means that the deep veins are blocked. When deep venous thrombosis occurs in the lower limbs, the deep venous blood return is obstructed, and the Perthes test is positive (D pair). At this time, high ligation of the great saphenous vein is strictly prohibited. 5 \"P\" performance (A error) is the typical clinical manifestation of acute arterial embolism, namely pain, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness, and pallor, because acute arterial embolism in the lower limbs Embolism leads to reduced blood supply to the distal limbs of the arteries and metabolic dysfunction of distal limb tissues, leading to accumulation of metabolites and neurological dysfunction. Buerger test: Also known as postural color change, first raise the lower limbs 70 to 80°, or raise the upper limbs overhead for 60 seconds. The distal skin of the normal limbs remains light red or slightly white. If it is pale or waxy white, it indicates arteries. Insufficient blood supply; then droop the lower limbs on the edge of the bed or droop the upper limbs beside the body. Normal people's skin color can recover within 10 seconds. If the recovery time exceeds 45 seconds and the color is uneven, it further indicates arterial blood supply disorder. The limbs continue to droop, and normal people only have mild flushing at most. Anyone with obvious flushing or cyanosis indicates venous reflux or reflux disorder. Therefore, a positive Buerger test (B error) is not associated with venous thrombosis of the lower extremities. A significant increase in venous blood oxygen content (C error) is mainly seen in diseases with tissue oxygen utilization disorders, such as cyanide poisoning. Great saphenous vein valve function test: Also known as Trendelenburg test, it mainly checks whether the function of the lower limb vein valves is good.

A positive hepatic jugular reflux sign (False D) means that when right heart failure causes hepatic congestion and enlargement, pressing the enlarged liver with hands can make the jugular veins dilate more obviously. The mechanism of its occurrence is that the amount of blood returning to the heart increases due to the compression of the congested liver. The congested right atrium cannot accept the blood returning to the heart, so the jugular venous pressure is forced to rise. It is more common in right heart failure.",

        "Option B": "increased cardiac output",
        "Option C": "Sclerosis of the aorta and large arteries",
        "Option D": "Increased circulating blood volume",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. When the aorta and large arteries harden, the elastic fibers of the wall decrease and the collagen fibers increase. The elastic reservoir function of the large arteries is weakened, and the buffering effect on blood pressure is weakened. Therefore, the systolic blood pressure increases and the diastolic blood pressure decreases, resulting in a significant increase in pulse pressure (C right). Changes in peripheral resistance mainly affect diastolic blood pressure. When peripheral resistance increases, blood outflow slows down during diastole, so diastolic blood pressure increases significantly; during systole, arterial blood pressure increases, causing blood flow to accelerate, so systolic blood pressure increases. The high is not as obvious as the increase in diastolic blood pressure, so the pulse pressure decreases (A is wrong). Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. When cardiac output increases, it may be an increase in stroke volume or an acceleration of heart rate within a certain range. Changes in stroke volume mainly affect systolic blood pressure. When stroke volume increases, the amount of blood injected into the aorta during systole increases, and the pressure on the arterial wall also increases, so systolic blood pressure increases significantly; due to arterial blood pressure When the heart rate increases, the blood flow speed accelerates. The amount of blood remaining in the aorta does not increase much at the end of diastole. The increase in diastolic blood pressure is relatively small, so the pulse pressure increases. When the heart rate accelerates, the ventricular diastole period is significantly shortened, so during diastole, the pulse pressure increases. The blood volume flowing from the aorta to the periphery decreases during the diastolic period, and the blood volume retained in the aorta increases, resulting in a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure; due to the increased blood volume retained in the aorta at the end of diastole, the blood volume in the aorta increases during systole. Systolic blood pressure also increases accordingly, but because the increase in blood pressure accelerates blood flow, more blood flows to the periphery during systole, making the systolic blood pressure increase to a smaller extent, and the pulse pressure decreases (B error). Under physiological conditions, the circulating blood volume matches the capacity of the vascular system, that is, the circulating blood volume is slightly more than the vascular system capacity, causing it to produce a certain average filling pressure of the circulatory system. This is an important prerequisite for the formation of blood pressure. The average filling pressure Determined by the ratio of circulating blood volume and vascular system volume, the impact on pulse pressure cannot be determined by simply increasing circulating blood volume (D is wrong).",

        "Explanation": "Intestinal obstruction complications may occur early after subtotal gastrectomy, which are mainly divided into input loop obstruction, output loop obstruction and anastomotic obstruction. Obstruction of the output segment prevents food mixed with bile from descending smoothly through the obstruction into the intestinal lumen, causing upper abdominal fullness and vomiting of food and bile (pair B). Sudden severe pain in the right upper quadrant and localized peritoneal irritation (wrong A) are manifestations of duodenal stump rupture. Due to improper handling of the duodenal stump or obstruction of the Bi type II input loop, the contents of the duodenum The broken end enters the abdominal cavity, causing abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation. Sudden severe pain in the upper abdomen, frequent vomiting, and no bile (C wrong) are manifestations of anastomotic obstruction. Because the downward flow of food is blocked, but the bile outflow tract is unobstructed, vomiting without bile occurs when abdominal pressure increases. Palpitations, sweating, nausea, and diarrhea after eating (False D) are manifestations of early dumping syndrome. Because hypertonic gastric contents enter the intestinal lumen too quickly, a large amount of vasoactive substances are secreted in the intestine, resulting in relative insufficient blood volume. Persistent burning pain under the xiphoid process, worsened after eating, and antacids are ineffective (E is wrong) is a typical manifestation of alkaline reflux gastritis. Alkaline intestinal juice refluxes into the stomach, causing congestion and erosion of the gastric mucosa, destroying the gastric mucosa. The barrier effect has little to do with gastric acid secretion, so antacids are ineffective.",

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "AB",
        "Explanation": "When there is a large amount of pericardial effusion (B pair) or constrictive pericarditis (A pair), the right ventricular diastole is limited during inhalation, the blood return volume is reduced, affecting the right heart blood output, and the right ventricle discharges blood into the pulmonary circulation. The amount of blood is reduced accordingly; on the other hand, the pulmonary circulation is affected by the negative pressure in the chest during inhalation, and the pulmonary blood vessels expand, resulting in a reduction in the amount of blood returned from the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, thus reducing left ventricular blood output. These factors together cause the pulse to weaken or even become unpalpable during inspiration, resulting in abnormal pulse. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (C) is a type of cardiomyopathy characterized by increased ventricular wall stiffness, reduced diastolic function, and limited filling, resulting in clinical symptoms of right heart failure. Most patients have normal systolic function, so there is no significant decrease in cardiac output, and generally no abnormal pulse occurs. In left heart failure (D error), alternating strong and weak ventricular contractions may occur, leading to alternans.",

        "Correct Answer": "AB",
        "Explanation": "The treatment principle of atrioventricular block is to remove the cause, maintain a certain level of ventricular rate, and maintain a more ideal cardiac output. Atropine (A pair) can increase the heart rate in atrioventricular block and is suitable for patients with block located in the atrioventricular node. Isoproterenol (B pair) is suitable for any location of atrioventricular block. In addition, depending on the degree of ventricular rhythm slowdown due to atrioventricular block, for those with mild or high degree of block but ventricular rate >40 beats/min, drugs such as atropine and isoproterenol can be used. However, if the ventricular rate is significantly slow, the Patients with obvious symptoms or hemodynamic disorders or even Adams-Strokes syndrome should be given temporary or permanent cardiac pacing treatment as soon as possible. Dexamethasone (C) is a glucocorticoid that mainly exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects. It is a first-aid drug for critical illness and a treatment drug for various types of inflammation. Quinidine (D error) can significantly prolong the refractory period of myocardium, reduce automaticity, conductivity and myocardial contractility. It has a strong effect on non-sinus ectopic rhythm, slowing heart rate and low extracellular potassium. It is easy to induce early depolarization and is suitable for the conversion and prevention of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, and can also be used for the treatment of frequent supraventricular and premature ventricular contractions. In addition, The side effects of quinidine include atrioventricular block, so this option is not selected. (Eighth Edition of Pharmacology P194-P195).",

        "Correct Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "In the systemic circulation, during the process of blood flowing from the aorta to the atrium, energy needs to be continuously consumed to overcome resistance, so blood pressure gradually decreases. In each segment of blood vessels, the magnitude of the drop in blood pressure is proportional to the resistance to blood flow in that segment of blood vessels, and the most important factor affecting blood flow resistance is the radius of the blood vessel r (blood flow resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of r) ( P116). In the arterial segment of large and medium arteries (A pair), because the blood vessel radius r is larger, the blood pressure drop is smaller. When reaching the small and arterioles (B pair), the blood vessel r radius decreases significantly, the blood flow resistance increases, and the blood pressure decreases. Significantly (especially in the arteriole segment). When blood reaches venules through capillaries, blood pressure also drops significantly, but the drop is smaller than when it flows through arterioles (see P117 Figure 4-23) (C error). When blood returns to the vena cava through the venous system and flows into the right atrium, the blood pressure drops to close to 0 mmHg, but the drop is small (D is wrong).",

DDD type (A error) pacemaker represents: it paces the atrium and ventricle, and senses its own atrium and ventricular signals. After the atrium and ventricle are sensed, the pacemaker triggers or inhibits the pacemaker to send a pulse during the refractory period. , Therefore, this type of pacemaker is suitable for patients with atrioventricular block with or without sinus node dysfunction. VVI type (B error) pacemaker represents: it paces the ventricle and senses its own ventricular signal. After its own ventricular signal is sensed, it inhibits the pacemaker from sending a pulse. Therefore, this type is suitable for patients with slow ventricular rate and no pulse. Patients with structural heart disease and normal cardiac function. AAI type (C error) pacemaker represents: it is the atrium that paces, and it senses its own atrial signal. After its own atrial signal is sensed, it inhibits the pacemaker from sending a pulse, so this type is suitable for patients whose disease is in the atrium. Patients with sick sinus syndrome who have normal atrioventricular conduction have physiological pacing. The VOO type (D error) pacemaker represents that the pacing is done in the ventricle, but there is no part that senses the signal, and there is no reaction after sensing. Therefore, this type is a relatively mechanical fixed-frequency ventricular pacemaker, and it is now Deprecated. The ICD type is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. It can continuously monitor the patient's heart rhythm. When an arrhythmia is detected in the patient's ventricle, it will release a current pulse to the heart to restore its normal heartbeat. If the normal heart rhythm still cannot be restored or the patient's ventricles begin to fibrillate, the ICD will release high-energy electrical pulses (shocks) to the heart to achieve defibrillation. Therefore, ICD type (E pair) should be the first choice for patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia accompanied by short bursts of loss of consciousness.",

When the heart rate slows down, the diastolic period of the ventricle is prolonged, the blood volume flowing from the aorta to the periphery increases, and the blood volume remaining in the aorta decreases, resulting in a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (pair A). As the blood volume retained in the aorta decreases at the end of diastole, the blood volume in the aorta decreases during systole, and the systolic blood pressure also decreases accordingly (pair A). Both AB and AB are correct for this question, and the correct answer is C.",

The letter A represents the atrium, V represents the ventricle, and the first two letters represent the atrium. The letter D all stands for dual chamber, the last letter D stands for trigger and inhibition, I stands for inhibition, and O stands for none. VVI type pacemaker represents: it paces the ventricle and senses its own ventricular signal. After its own ventricular signal is sensed, it inhibits the pacemaker from sending a pulse. Therefore, this type is suitable for chronic atrial fibrillation with second-degree atrioventricular conduction. Blockers (B pair) and other patients with slow ventricular rate and normal cardiac function without structural heart disease. DDD type (A error) pacemaker represents: it paces the atrium and ventricle, and senses its own atrium and ventricular signals. After the atrium and ventricle are sensed, the pacemaker triggers or inhibits the pacemaker to send a pulse during the refractory period. , Therefore, this type of pacemaker is suitable for patients with atrioventricular block with or without sinus node dysfunction. AAI type (C error) pacemaker represents: it is the atrium that paces, and it senses its own atrial signal. After its own atrial signal is sensed, it inhibits the pacemaker from sending a pulse, so this type is suitable for patients whose disease is in the atrium. Patients with sick sinus syndrome who have normal atrioventricular conduction have physiological pacing. The VOO type (D error) pacemaker represents that the pacing is done in the ventricle, but there is no part that senses the signal, and there is no reaction after sensing. Therefore, this type is a relatively mechanical fixed-frequency ventricular pacemaker, and it is now Deprecated. The ICD type is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. It can continuously monitor the patient's heart rhythm. When an arrhythmia is detected in the patient's ventricle, it will release a current pulse to the heart to restore its normal heartbeat. If the normal heart rhythm still cannot be restored or the patient's ventricles begin to fibrillate, the ICD will release high-energy electrical pulses (shocks) to the heart to achieve defibrillation. Therefore, ICD type (E error) should be the first choice for patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia accompanied by short-term loss of consciousness.",

Myogenic autoregulation refers to when the supply of When the perfusion pressure of a certain organ's blood vessels increases within a certain range, the vascular smooth muscle is stimulated by stretch, and the myogenic activity of the blood vessels (especially the precapillary resistance blood vessels) is enhanced, which increases the blood flow resistance of the organ's blood vessels to prevent Blood flow to the organ increases due to increased perfusion pressure. On the contrary, when the perfusion pressure of the organ's blood vessels decreases within a certain range, the resistance blood vessels dilate and the local blood flow resistance decreases to prevent the organ's blood flow from being reduced due to the decrease in perfusion pressure. This myogenic autoregulatory mechanism is particularly evident in renal blood vessels and can also be seen in blood vessels of the brain (pair C), heart, liver, mesentery, and skeletal muscle, but skin blood vessels generally do not have this manifestation.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "According to the time course of arterial blood pressure regulation by various neurological and humoral factors, arterial blood pressure regulation can be divided into short-term regulation and long-term regulation. Short-term regulation refers to the regulation of blood pressure changes that occur in a short period of time, mainly through neural regulation, through the regulation of resistance blood vessel caliber and cardiac activity; long-term regulation refers to the regulation of blood pressure changes that occur within a longer period of time (hours, several seconds). Days, months or longer) is mainly achieved through the kidney's regulation of extracellular fluid volume: when the extracellular fluid volume in the body increases, the blood volume increases, and there is a gap between the blood volume and the circulatory system capacity. The relative relationship changes, causing arterial blood pressure to rise. When arterial blood pressure rises, it can directly lead to increased renal drainage and sodium excretion, expelling excess body fluids from the body, thereby returning blood pressure to normal levels; extracellular fluid in the body When fluid volume decreases, the opposite process occurs, whereby renal drainage and sodium excretion decrease, allowing body fluid volume and arterial blood pressure to recover. This mechanism is called the renal-humor control mechanism (pair D).",

        "Option C": "Have both",
        "Option D": "neither",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When the heart's ejection capacity increases, the amount of blood injected into the aorta during systole increases, and arterial blood pressure increases (pair A). As the ejection volume increases, the remaining blood volume in the ventricle decreases, and the intraventricular pressure during diastole decreases, thereby increasing the suction force of blood in the atrium and veins, causing the central venous pressure to decrease (B pair), and promoting the increase in blood return to the heart. Both increased blood volume and enhanced cardiac ejection capacity can increase the amount of blood returned to the heart, but the former causes an increase in central venous pressure, and the latter causes a decrease in central venous pressure. This is because an increase in blood volume → an increase in blood return → an increase in central venous pressure High, and the ejection capacity of the heart is enhanced → the central venous pressure is reduced → the amount of blood returned to the heart is increased. Both AB and AB are correct for this question, and the correct answer is C.",

        "Correct Answer": "ABC",
        "Explanation": "The principle of the T₃ suppression test is as follows: The pituitary-thyroid axis of normal people has a feedback regulation relationship. Therefore, after taking exogenous T₃, the T₃ concentration in the blood increases, inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of endogenous TSH through negative feedback, resulting in a significant thyroid¹³¹I uptake rate. Reduced; in patients with diffuse toxic goiter, due to the presence of pathological thyroid stimulants (TRAb, etc.), stimulation of the thyroid gland causes a significant increase in the ¹³¹I uptake rate, which is not inhibited by T₃. The T₃ (triiodothyronine) suppression test can be used to differentiate between simple goiter and other types of hyperthyroidism (D is wrong). T₃ (triiodothyronine) and thyroid hormone act on the heart to increase heart rate, increase blood volume, increase the load on the heart, and induce cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this test is prohibited for elderly patients (Pair A), patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (Pair B), hyperthyroid heart disease (Pair C), and severe hyperthyroidism to avoid inducing arrhythmia, angina pectoris, or hyperthyroid crisis.",

It also reduces blood pressure and plasma vasopressin and aldosterone levels, reduces the reabsorption of sodium and water by the renal distal tubule and collecting duct, and reduces circulating blood volume and extracellular fluid volume. Therefore, the volume-sensitive reflex increases in circulating blood volume. It has important physiological significance in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume. Baroreceptive (P132) reflex means that when arterial blood pressure increases, the incoming impulses from the baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and aortic arch increase. Through the integration of related cardiovascular centers, the cardiovagal tone is enhanced, and the cardiac sympathetic tone and sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone are reduced. , its effects are slowing down the heart rate, reducing cardiac output, reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and arterial blood pressure falling back. The baroreceptor reflex rapidly regulates arterial blood pressure in the event of sudden changes in cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, blood volume, etc. plays an important role in the process (pair B). Chemoreceptor reflex (P133) refers to the situation where the carotid body and aortic body chemoreceptors are stimulated under conditions such as hypoxia, asphyxia, blood loss, hypotension, and acidosis, which reflexively causes an increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and coronary artery disease. Effects such as arterial dilation, skeletal muscle and visceral vasoconstriction, etc. Since the blood vessels of the heart and brain have no obvious contraction or slight relaxation, the circulating blood volume can be redistributed. Therefore, the chemoreceptive reflex is redistributing the circulating blood volume to ensure that the heart, brain, etc. Play an important role in the regulation of blood supply to vital organs. The axon reflex (P130) is a cardiovascular reflex caused by somatosensory receptors. When the skin is subjected to noxious stimulation, the sensory impulses are conducted along the afferent fibers to the center on the one hand, and on the other hand, they can reach the terminal branches along other branches. The arterioles adjacent to the stimulated area cause the arterioles to dilate and the local skin will appear flushed. This reaction, which is completed only through the peripheral parts of the axon, is called an axonal reflex.",

        "Explanation": "Baroreceptor reflex (P132) means that when arterial blood pressure increases, the incoming impulses from the baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and aortic arch increase. Through the integration of related cardiovascular centers, the cardiovagal tone is enhanced, and the cardiac sympathetic tone and sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone are reduced. , its effects are slowing down the heart rate, reducing cardiac output, reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and arterial blood pressure falling back. The baroreceptor reflex rapidly regulates arterial blood pressure in the event of sudden changes in cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, blood volume, etc. plays an important role in the process. (P246) When circulating blood volume or arterial blood pressure decreases, the plasma crystal osmotic concentration that causes the release of antidiuretic hormone can be reduced, that is, the sensitivity of osmoreceptors to corresponding stimuli is increased; conversely, when circulating blood volume or arterial blood pressure increases, , can increase the plasma crystal osmolality concentration that causes the release of antidiuretic hormone, that is, reduce the sensitivity of osmoreceptors. Chemoreceptive reflex (P133) refers to the situation where the carotid body and aortic body chemoreceptors are stimulated under conditions such as hypoxia, asphyxia, blood loss, hypotension, and acidosis, which reflexively causes heart rate to slow down, cardiac output to decrease, and coronary artery disease to increase. Effects such as arterial dilation, skeletal muscle and visceral vasoconstriction, etc. Since the blood vessels of the heart and brain have no obvious contraction or slight relaxation, the circulating blood volume can be redistributed. Therefore, the chemoreceptive reflex is redistributing the circulating blood volume to ensure that the heart, brain, etc. Play an important role in the regulation of blood supply to vital organs. Cardiopulmonary receptor reflex (P133), also known as volume receptor reflex, refers to that when blood volume increases, the cardiopulmonary receptors in the atrium wall are stimulated by stretch, which not only causes sympathetic nerve inhibition and vagus nerve excitation, but also slows down the heart rate, reduces cardiac output, and increases peripheral resistance. It also reduces plasma vasopressin and aldosterone levels (pair C), reduces the reabsorption of sodium and water by the renal distal tubule and collecting duct, and reduces blood volume and extracellular fluid volume, so the cardiorespiratory reflex is It has important physiological significance in the regulation of blood volume and extracellular fluid volume. Cerebral ischemic response (P134) refers to the process in which when cerebral blood flow is reduced, sympathetic vasoconstrictor tension is significantly enhanced, peripheral blood vessels are highly contracted, and arterial blood pressure is increased to improve cerebral blood supply.

        "Explanation": "The transmitter released by most sympathetic postganglionic fibers is norepinephrine (except for the sympathetic postganglionic fibers that innervate sweat glands and skeletal muscle blood vessels that release acetylcholine). The activity of the sympathetic nervous system is related to the distribution of norepinephrine receptors on various organs. . When sympathetic nerves are excited, the α₂ receptors acting on pancreatic beta cells (i.e. B cells) inhibit insulin secretion (B error); the β₂ receptors acting on skeletal muscle cells promote the decomposition of muscle glycogen (C error); α₁ receptors in skin blood vessels constrict skin blood vessels (pair D). Skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by somatic motor nerves (P399) and is not controlled by visceral motor nerves (sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves) (A is wrong). Here, \"skeletal muscle\" should not be confused with \"skeletal muscle blood vessels\", which is Controlled by visceromotor nerves. The state of sympathetic nerve excitement can be used to assist memory with the body's physiological state during strenuous exercise: During strenuous exercise, the body's sympathetic nerves are excited (P336), the heart rate accelerates, myocardial contractility increases, and cardiac output increases, with the purpose of providing muscle strength throughout the body. Provide more blood and oxygen; respiratory movement is strengthened, bronchial smooth muscles relax, and alveolar ventilation is intended to provide more oxygen to the blood; vascular smooth muscles in the skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal and other parts of the body all contract, but skeletal muscle blood vessels The purpose of relaxation is to redistribute blood and provide more blood to the muscles; because the whole body blood is distributed to the skeletal muscles, the blood supply to the gastrointestinal tract is insufficient, which is not conducive to digestion and absorption of the gastrointestinal tract, so the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract relax and the sphincter contraction, the secretion of digestive glands decreases; during strenuous exercise, the secretion of catabolic hormones such as thyroid hormone and glucagon increases, and glycogen decomposition increases, in order to provide more energy sources for skeletal muscles, etc.",

The main drugs include clopidogrel, pyruvate The antiplatelet effects of lagrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel are affected by liver metabolism, with large individual differences and many drug interactions. Therefore, if there is resistance to clopidogrel, ticagrelor (pair A) can be used. The drug is a new type of P₂Y₁₂ receptor antagonist with precise efficacy, small individual differences, and increasing clinical applications. It has been recommended as a drug that takes priority over clopidogrel in European and American countries. Bivalirudin (False D) is mainly used for anticoagulation during PCI in UA/NSTEMI patients (P233). Ivabradine (B error) is used for the treatment of heart failure. It can slow down the sinus heart rate. For patients who are intolerant to beta-blockers, it can be used when the sinus rhythm is in sinus rhythm and the heart rate is ≥75 beats/minute. Levosimendan (C error) is a calcium-sensitizing drug that acts on contractile proteins and enhances myocardial contractility. It is suitable for patients with acute left heart failure who do not have significant hypotension or tendency to hypotension (P176).",

        "Explanation": "Cardiac insufficiency is abnormal cardiac diastolic function caused by different causes, including the entire process from complete compensation to decompensation of the heart's pumping function. Heart failure is a decompensated state of cardiac function. Both of them are in the process. The pathogenesis is essentially the same, but the degree differs. Left ventricular insufficiency is mainly manifested by pulmonary congestion and reduced cardiac output, such as varying degrees of dyspnea: exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and in the most severe cases, acute pulmonary edema and cough. , expectoration, hemoptysis, and systemic symptoms may include fatigue, fatigue, dizziness, palpitation, etc., which are the main symptoms caused by insufficient cardiac output, insufficient perfusion of organs and tissues, and compensatory accelerated heart rate. The valvular disease most prone to clinical manifestations of left ventricular dysfunction is mitral valve stenosis (C pair). The earliest hemodynamic change is an increase in left atrial pressure. This increase in pressure is a gradual process and eventually It can be transmitted to the pulmonary veins to cause pulmonary congestion, and chronic increase in pulmonary venous pressure can lead to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. The course of simple mitral regurgitation (D error) is often long, and the asymptomatic period can last for decades. Once symptoms appear, the left ventricular function will plummet and obvious symptoms will occur. Aortic stenosis (A error) can go through a long asymptomatic period. Once it occurs, it progresses rapidly. The typical symptoms are the triad of exertional dyspnea (late stage of the disease), angina pectoris, and syncope. The early symptoms are often atypical and are easily diagnosed. ignore. Chronic aortic regurgitation may be asymptomatic for a long period of time due to compensatory changes in the left ventricle. In severe cases, symptoms of left heart failure may occur. Symptoms in patients with acute aortic regurgitation are mainly related to the severity of regurgitation. In mild cases, Some patients are asymptomatic, while severe cases may develop left heart failure or pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, myocardial ischemia, or even sudden death (B error).",

        "Explanation": "Injecting local anesthetic into the subarachnoid space, blocking the conduction function of part of the spinal nerves and causing anesthesia in the corresponding controlled areas is called subarachnoid block, also known as spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is mainly suitable for operations on the lower abdomen, pelvis, lower limbs and anus and perineum within 2 to 3 hours, such as appendectomy, hernia repair, meniscus removal, hemorrhoidectomy, anal fistula resection, etc. Commonly used drugs include procaine (action time is 1 to 1.5 hours), tetracaine (action time is 2 to 3 hours), and bupivacaine (action time is 5 to 6 hours). Spinal anesthesia itself is a risky operation. Toxic reactions of local anesthetics may occur during the process, and excessive anesthesia may also cause symptoms such as blood pressure and low heart rate during the anesthesia process. Therefore, it is necessary to open an intravenous channel for emergency treatment (pair B). When blood pressure drops significantly, first replenish fluids and expand volume. If the effect is not obvious, intravenous injection of ephedrine can increase blood pressure (ephedrine is an alpha and beta receptor agonist, which not only promotes vasoconstriction, but also stimulates the heart to pump blood, thereby restoring blood pressure. ) (C pair). The plasma protein binding rate of tetracaine is 76%, while the plasma protein binding rate of procaine is only 5.8%. Therefore, the anesthesia time of tetracaine is longer than that of procaine (pair A). Post-spinal anesthesia headache is a low-pressure headache, which is caused by the loss of cerebrospinal fluid after spinal anesthesia. When standing, the cerebrospinal fluid flows into the spine, which increases the hydrostatic pressure, increases cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and lowers intracranial pressure, causing the headache to worsen and relieve after lying down. or disappear (pair D).",

        "Correct Answer": "BCD",
        "Explanation": "The level of arterial diastolic blood pressure and the length of the diastolic period are important factors affecting CBF. The higher the diastolic blood pressure, the longer the diastolic period, and the greater the coronary blood flow. Therefore, when the diastolic blood pressure increases and the diastolic period is prolonged, the coronary blood flow increases (BC pair). If the ventricular systole is prolonged, the ventricular diastole will be shortened and the coronary blood flow will be reduced (False A). The direct effect of sympathetic nerves is to constrict coronary arteries, which is mainly achieved by activating α-receptors on vascular smooth muscle; but enhanced sympathetic activity can accelerate the heart rate, enhance myocardial contractility, and consume blood through activating β₁-receptors on myocardium. The amount of oxygen increases and metabolism intensifies, resulting in an increase in metabolites. Through the metabolic autoregulation mechanism (see P139-P140), it secondaryly causes coronary artery dilation. In the case of strenuous exercise or massive blood loss, sympathetic nerve excitement causes systemic blood vessels to constrict, but coronary blood vessels do not shrink significantly. This ensures the preferential supply of coronary blood flow through the redistribution of systemic blood volume (there is also a preferential supply of cerebral blood flow).

        "Explanation": "In a quiet state, the blood perfusion volume (renal blood flow) of the two kidneys of healthy adults is about 1200ml/min, which is equivalent to 20% to 25% of the cardiac output, and the kidneys only account for about 0.5% of the body weight. Therefore, the renal blood flow Abundant supply (Pair A). The blood supply to different parts of the kidney is uneven. About 94% of the blood flow supplies the renal cortex, about 5% supplies the outer marrow, and the remaining less than 1% supplies the inner marrow. Therefore, the renal cortex has more blood flow and the renal medullary has less blood flow. (B is wrong). The renal blood flow passes through two capillary branches (C pair): the first capillary branch is the glomerular capillary network, which has higher blood pressure and is conducive to glomerular filtration; the second capillary branch is the glomerular capillary network.

        "Explanation": "Portal hypertension has no significant impact on body metabolism, and due to damage to liver function, reduced plasma protein synthesis, and the production of ascites, patients may experience symptoms of edema instead of weight loss (A is wrong). In portal hypertension, liver congestion and enlargement may occur. Portal blood supply accounts for about 70% of liver blood supply. When portal hypertension occurs, liver blood supply is reduced, liver cell metabolism is disordered, and abnormal liver function may occur (pair B). Portal hypertension can lead to the opening of the communicating branches of the portal vein and vena cava system, resulting in esophageal varices (C pair). Increased portal vein pressure increases the filtration pressure of the capillary bed of the portal venous system. At the same time, hypoalbuminemia caused by liver cirrhosis, plasma colloid osmotic pressure decreases, and lymph fluid production increases, causing fluid to leak from the liver surface and intestinal serosal surface.

In constrictive pericarditis, the heart boundary is generally small or slightly larger (pair B). The slight enlargement may be due to pericardial thickening or a small amount of pericardial effusion. In constrictive pericarditis, ventricular relaxation is limited and ventricular filling is reduced. During inspiration, the blood volume of the pulmonary circulation increases, the pulmonary venous return further decreases, and the left ventricular ejection volume is too low, resulting in pulse paradoxus (C pair). However, the ninth edition of Internal Medicine P306 believes that pulse paradoxus is uncommon, so pulse paradoxus is not constrictive pericarditis.

Benzamidozoline, also known as phentolamine, is an α-adrenergic receptor blocker (P175), which can relax vascular smooth muscles, thereby dilating blood vessels, reducing peripheral resistance, and reducing pulmonary capillary pressure, thereby reducing pulmonary artery pressure. Reduce right heart afterload and improve right heart function in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease (B pair); reduce peripheral vascular resistance, reduce left heart afterload, increase left heart blood output, and improve left heart function; research has confirmed that bronchial smooth muscle With the presence of alpha receptors, phentolamine can relax bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasm, and improve ventilatory function (pair A).

        "Correct Answer": "BD",
        "Explanation": "In emergency situations, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the role of the drug is to obtain the most effective therapeutic effect in the shortest possible time. Intravenous administration (D pair) is preferred. The drug directly enters the blood circulation, and the blood with high blood drug concentration It flows through all tissues of the body and acts on target organs, acting quickly and effectively. Intraosseous drugs also enter the bloodstream directly and are also considered the preferred route of administration. Although intracardiac injection of drugs directly acts on the heart, this operation is actually difficult and risky. It cannot guarantee the rescue effect and may even aggravate the damage to the body (A is wrong). Epinephrine has the following characteristics: ① It has an stimulating effect on α and β adrenergic receptors, which helps to restore the autonomic heart rhythm; ② It can increase diastolic blood pressure and increase the total peripheral vascular resistance without increasing the resistance of coronary and cerebral blood vessels; ③ It can enhance myocardial contractility, convert patients with ventricular fibrillation from fine fibrillation waves to coarse fibrillation waves, and improve the success rate of electric defibrillation.

        "Option C": "nuclear receptor",
        "Option D": "guanylyl cyclase receptor",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "BD",
        "Explanation": "Second messengers refer to intracellular messenger molecules produced after extracellular messenger molecules (first messengers) such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines act on membrane receptors (P27). Currently known second messengers include cAMP, inositol triphosphate (IP₃), diacylglycerol (DG), cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Ca²⁺, arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites, etc. G protein-coupled receptors (B pair) are the most classic receptors that mediate signal transduction. The cell signaling pathways mediated by G protein-coupled receptors mainly include \"G protein-coupled receptor- G protein-AC-cAMP-PKA\" pathway and \"G protein-coupled receptor-G protein-PLC-IP₃-Ca²⁺ and DG-PKC pathway\". The second messenger molecule of the \"G protein-coupled receptor-G protein-AC-cAMP-PKA\" pathway is cAMP, so this pathway is also called the cAMP second messenger system. The second messenger molecules of the \"G protein-coupled receptor-G protein-PLC-IP₃-Ca²⁺ and DG-PKC pathway\" are IP₃ and DG, so this pathway is also called the IP₃ and DG second messenger system. In the signal transduction mediated by the guanylyl cyclase receptor (D pair), second messenger molecules are also involved: the guanylyl cyclase (GC) receptor is an extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding It is a single transmembrane α-helical molecule with a GC active domain at its intracellular C terminus. The ligands that activate this receptor are mainly atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). When the receptor is activated by a ligand, it can catalyze GTP in the cytoplasm to generate cGMP through its GC activity. The latter serves as a second messenger to further activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), and PKG acts as a serine/threonine acid protein kinase, and then phosphorylates the substrate protein to achieve signal transduction. In a narrow sense, ion channel receptors are chemically gated channels (P18, P25) in facilitated diffusion of channels. They are a type of membrane protein with both channel and receptor functions. Ion channel receptors bind to ligands. Afterwards, the ion channel opens and the cell membrane becomes more permeable to specific ions, causing a change in the cell membrane potential and realizing the function of transmembrane signal transduction. This signal transduction process does not require the participation of a second messenger (A is wrong). Broadly speaking, ion channel receptors should also include voltage-gated channels and mechanical-gated channels (P26). Both of them can accept electrical signals and mechanical signals, and transmit signals through the opening and closing of channels and changes in ion flow across membranes. Inside the cell, the L-type Ca²⁺ channel on the T-tubule membrane of cardiomyocytes is a voltage-gated channel. When an action potential occurs in cardiomyocytes, depolarization of the T-tubule membrane can activate this Ca²⁺ channel, causing Ca²⁺ Influx increases the sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration; the influx of Ca²⁺ also serves as a second messenger (A), further activating the Ca²⁺ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a further increase in the sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration, thereby triggering The contraction of cardiomyocytes achieves transmembrane signal transduction triggered by electrical signals (action potentials) (3rd edition, 8th grade physiology P38). Nuclear receptors are essentially a large class of transcription regulators (P30) that regulate the transcription of specific proteins by hormones. They can directly bind to DNA in the nucleus to regulate the transcription process without the involvement of second messengers (C is wrong).",

When arterial blood pressure decreases, the reflex weakens, causing the heart rate to increase, cardiac output to increase, peripheral resistance to increase, and blood pressure to rise.

Atrioventricular dissociation means that patients with atrioventricular dissociation have two activation points. The activation point of the atrium controls the atrium, and the activation point of the ventricle controls the ventricle. Therefore, the atrial rate and the ventricular rate are often inconsistent. Atrioventricular dissociation includes pathological third-degree atrioventricular block (B error) and physiological interference atrioventricular dissociation (P178) (A pair). The former has a slower ventricular rate, often less than 60 beats/min, and has more P waves than QRS waves. The latter refers to the separation caused by the absolute interference between atrioventricular and sinusoidal activation in the atrioventricular junction area for three or more consecutive times and junctional or ventricular activation, which is manifested by a faster ventricular rate and often More than 60 times/min, the number of P waves is less than that of QRS waves. In sinoatrial block (C error), the impulse generated by the sinoatrial node cannot depolarize the atrium or delays atrial depolarization. The most common second-degree sinoatrial block is divided into two types: Mohs type I. Mohs' type II block is characterized by a progressive shortening of the PP interval until a long PP interval occurs, which is shorter than twice the basic PP interval; in Mohs type II block, the long PP interval is the basic Integer multiple of PP interval. It is inconsistent with the electrocardiogram in this case. Ventricular escape rhythm (D error) refers to when the excitement in the sinoatrial node or the atrium and the atrioventricular junction area cannot be transmitted on time due to some reasons, then the lower level ventricle acts as a pacemaker and sends out excitement to control the ventricle. , forming a ventricular escape beat, and three or more consecutive ventricular escape beats constitute a ventricular escape rhythm.",

The mechanism is that the ventricular contraction occurs immediately after the atrial contraction, and the ventricle is relatively incompletely relaxed and not filled with blood. , the mitral valve is in a lower position, and rapid ventricular contraction causes the mitral valve to close quickly and forcefully, making the first heart sound stronger. It is more common in complete (third-degree) atrioventricular block (D pair). During auscultation in first-degree atrioventricular block (A error), the intensity of the first heart sound is weakened due to prolonged PR interval. Second degree type I atrioventricular block (P202) (B error) is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval until one P wave is blocked and cannot pass down to the ventricle, and the RR interval including the blocked P wave is smaller than the normal sinus PP interval. twice the period, and the intensity of the first heart sound gradually weakens and there is a missed beat. Second degree type II atrioventricular block (P202) (C error) is characterized by a constant PR interval with no QRS complex after the P wave, and intermittent beat leakage, but the intensity of the first heart sound is constant.",

        "Correct Answer": "AB",
        "Explanation": "When the release of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) decreases, water reabsorption decreases and urine output increases, causing dehydration in the body. When dehydration is severe, plasma crystal osmotic pressure increases, stimulating hypothalamic osmoreceptors, triggering thirst, and prompting the body to Increased water intake (pair A). Insulin secretion decreases, leading to an increase in blood sugar. When it exceeds the renal glucose threshold, it causes osmotic diuresis and increases urine output, causing the body to lose water. The plasma crystal osmotic pressure increases, causing thirst and prompting the body to drink more water (B pair). Profuse sweating, severe vomiting or diarrhea can cause the body to lose a lot of water, increase plasma crystal osmotic pressure, stimulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone, increase water reabsorption by renal tubules and collecting ducts, and reduce urine output (C is wrong). The increase in effective circulating blood volume and venous blood return to the heart can stimulate cardiopulmonary receptors, inhibit the release of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), and increase urine output. However, since there is no significant change in crystalloid osmotic pressure, it will not lead to large amounts of water drinking (D is wrong) ).",

An integer multiple of the period, but there is generally a QRS wave after the P wave. In patients with atrioventricular dissociation (A error), the P wave produced by atrial depolarization has nothing to do with the QRS wave produced by ventricular depolarization. Atrioventricular block (B) is divided into first, second, and third degrees. In first-degree atrioventricular block, P waves and QRS waves occur in sequence, with only the PR interval prolonged and no QRS wave falling off.

Therefore, the main difference between effusion pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis is whether there is an enlargement of the heart boundary ( D right). A large amount of exudative pericardial effusion can compress the heart and limit the diastolic function of the ventricle. In constrictive pericarditis, the pericardium is surrounded by dense and thickened fibrosis or calcification, forming a fixed cardiac sheath, which limits the diastolic function of the heart. .

Blood accumulates in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, and the pulmonary venous pressure increases. Because the pulmonary veins and the right heart have certain compensatory capabilities, right heart failure will not occur immediately when the left heart fails (A is incorrect). Infusion of too much fluid too quickly or accelerated venous return can increase the amount of blood returned to the heart and increase central venous pressure (BC pair). When the body position changes from supine to upright, the veins in the lower part of the body expand due to the increase in transmural pressure and can accommodate more blood.

        "Explanation": "The treatment principles of diastolic heart failure vary according to different causes. Diastolic failure caused by hypertension can appropriately reduce afterload, while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot reduce afterload (B error). When diastolic heart failure (HFpEF) occurs, left ventricular diastolic function is weakened, ventricular compliance is reduced, and filling disorders result in reduced ventricular end-diastolic volume, no significant change in ventricular end-systolic volume (ventricular systolic function is still normal), and stroke output. When the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is too high, the pulmonary venous pressure will also rise, leading to clinical manifestations of left heart failure such as pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema. However, this There was no significant decrease in cardiac output. Therefore, when there is obvious pulmonary congestion, appropriate application of diuretics, that is, appropriate reduction of preload, can alleviate the symptoms of pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, but it should not be excessive to avoid excessive reduction of preload and resulting in hypotension, because there is a certain ventricular pressure and capacity. It is the basis for patients with diastolic dysfunction and heart failure to maintain relatively normal cardiac output. Other treatment points include: ACEI, ARB, β-blocker and other treatments can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and improve ventricular diastolic function. Calcium channel antagonists can relax the myocardium. Although verapamil and diltiazem have certain effects, It has a negative inotropic effect, but can improve diastolic function by slowing down the heart rate. Option C is controversial because ACEI can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, but calcium antagonists cannot; actively control blood pressure, generally requiring <130/90mmHg; blood supply Reconstructive treatment (if patients with coronary heart disease have symptomatic or verifiable myocardial ischemia, coronary revascularization should be considered); those with a fast heart rate should control their heart rate, and patients with atrial fibrillation should pay more attention to heart rate control (pair A); It is not appropriate to use inotropic drugs. When systolic heart failure is combined with the disease, the latter should be mainly treated (D is wrong).",

        "Correct Answer": "BCD",
        "Explanation": "Because digitalis can inhibit the cardiac conduction system, with the most obvious inhibition in the atrioventricular junction area, and can slow down the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, digitalis is suitable for the treatment of atrial fibrillation combined with systolic heart failure. The application of digitalis in dilated cardiomyopathy combined with atrial fibrillation (D pair) can increase cardiac output, reduce ventricular rate, and effectively improve the patient's clinical symptoms. When coronary heart disease is complicated by atrial fibrillation (except within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction) (Pair B), and when rheumatic heart disease is complicated by atrial fibrillation (Pair C), digitalis drugs can effectively control ventricular rate. When preexcitation syndrome is combined with atrial fibrillation (A error), the application of digitalis can shorten the refractory period of the accessory pathway, causing more cardiac electrical activity to be transmitted down the accessory pathway and accelerating the ventricular rate, so it should not be used.",

        "Option D": "Decreased blood volume can increase its secretion",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "BD",
        "Explanation": "ADH is antidiuretic hormone, also known as vasopressin. It is secreted by the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is transported through the axons of the hypothalamic-pituitary tract (rather than through the pituitary portal vein. The hormone transported through the pituitary portal vein is lower Thalamic regulatory peptide) is transported to the neurohypophysis for storage (A error). ADH can act on the V₂ receptor of renal collecting duct epithelial cells (P245) (eighth edition P258 is the terminal segment of renal distal tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells). After activation, it activates adenylyl cyclase through excitatory G protein, causing Intracellular cAMP increases, and cAMP reactivates protein kinase A, causing vesicles containing aquaporin AQP-2 in epithelial cells to be embedded on the luminal membrane of epithelial cells, forming water channels, thus increasing the permeability of the luminal membrane to water. Sex (B pair). The release of ADH is mainly regulated and affected by plasma osmotic pressure and blood volume: when the body fluid osmotic pressure decreases, hypothalamic osmoreceptor stimulation decreases, and the secretion of antidiuretic hormone also decreases (C is wrong); when blood volume decreases, venous blood return to the heart decreases Reduced, the stimulation of cardiopulmonary receptors is weakened, the impulse transmitted to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve is reduced, and the inhibitory effect on ADH release is weakened or eliminated, so ADH secretion increases (D pair). The reference answer to this question is BD, but according to the latest view of the ninth edition textbook, option B is incorrect: P258 of the eighth edition textbook believes that ADH can act on the V₂ receptors of the posterior segment of the renal distal tubule (distal convoluted tubule) and collecting duct epithelial cells. In body, P245 of the ninth edition textbook only mentions collecting duct epithelial cells, and P236 clearly states that the distal convoluted tubule is impermeable to water.",

When the intracellular Na⁺ concentration increases, the Na⁺ concentration difference inside and outside the cell decreases, and the sodium pump is activated, expelling the excess Na⁺ out of the cell, maintaining the normal Na⁺ concentration difference inside and outside the cell. When the cell When the external Na⁺ concentration increases, the concentration difference of Na⁺ inside and outside the cell increases, and the sodium pump is inhibited, which inhibits the discharge of Na⁺ from the outside of the cell. It also inhibits the entry of K⁺ into the cell, and the intracellular K⁺ concentration decreases (D is wrong. ). Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchange and Na⁺-K⁺ exchange are secondary active transports. The driving force comes from the transmembrane concentration gradient of Na⁺. While Na⁺ flows inward along the concentration gradient, it drives the outflow of Ca²⁺ and K⁺.

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "ABC",
        "Explanation": "The vagus nerve is the 10th pair of nerves among the 12 pairs of cranial nerves. Compared with other cranial nerves, the vagus nerve has the longest course and is widely distributed, from motor organs to sensory organs, from the neck to the chest cavity, and to the abdominal cavity. Because it \"travels far away from home\" \", \"easy to get lost\", so it is called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a mixed nerve, containing four types of fibers: special visceral motor fibers (efferent fibers), general visceral motor fibers (efferent fibers), general visceral sensory fibers (afferent fibers), and general somatosensory fibers (afferent fibers). Ingredients (Pair B). Among them, the general visceral motor fibers are the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic nerve (D error), which are the main components of the vagus nerve. After being replaced by the ganglia, they innervate the heart, bronchi, esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, small intestine, part of the large intestine, etc. The smooth muscles and glands of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Since the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic ganglia that innervate the thoracic and abdominal organs run in the vagus nerve, we often refer to the parasympathetic nerve that innervates the thoracic and abdominal organs as the vagus nerve. For example, textbooks say, “The heart is dually innervated by the sympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve.” More A strict statement should be that \"the heart is dually innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, with the parasympathetic part coming from the parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve.\" Does that mean that the parasympathetic nerve is part of the vagus nerve? No, in addition to the part that runs in the tenth cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, the parasympathetic nerve also has parts in the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve) and the facial nerve (the seventh cranial nerve). Cranial nerve), glossopharyngeal nerve (9th cranial nerve) and pelvic nerve. Therefore, the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nerve are not equivalent, but have a mutually inclusive relationship. In fact, the vagus nerve is an anatomical definition of nerve fibers, while the parasympathetic nerve is a functional definition. The functional counterpart to the parasympathetic nerve is the sympathetic nerve. The sympathetic nerve and parasympathetic nerve constitute the visceral nervous system. (P335) The distribution of sympathetic nerves is extremely wide, while the distribution of parasympathetic nerves is relatively limited. Taking the cardiovascular system as an example, almost all vascular smooth muscles in the body are innervated by sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers, and only a few organs such as the meninges, salivary glands, and gastrointestinal Parasympathetic innervation of the vascular smooth muscles of the exocrine glands and external genitalia. Therefore, the parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve), when stimulated, has little direct effect on the intensity of vasoconstriction (pair A). The heart is dually innervated by the sympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve. Both the cardiac sympathetic nerve and the cardiac vagus nerve are tense at ordinary times. They antagonize each other and jointly regulate cardiac activity. However, in a quiet state, the cardiac vagus nerve is more dominant (C pair) (regardless of ordinary People are also long-distance runners).",

Typhoid nodules (A pair) and endometrial tuberculosis (B pair) are both infections. Sexual granuloma. The main pathological change of crescentic glomerulonephritis (P168) (False D) is the proliferation of glomerular parietal epithelial cells, not the proliferation of macrophages and their derived cells, and does not belong to granulomatous inflammation. Silicic nodules (C) are a highly controversial option. The formation and development of silicic nodules generally go through the following three stages (Pathology P236, 8th edition, third edition): ① Cellular nodules: early silicic nodules Nodules are formed locally by the accumulation of macrophages that eat silica dust; ② Fibrous nodules: composed of fibroblasts, fibroblasts and collagen fibers; ③ Hyalinous nodules: fibrous nodules undergo hyaline degeneration starting from the center , eventually forming typical silicon nodules. Fibrous nodules and hyaline nodules do not belong to granulomatous inflammation, while it is controversial whether cellular nodules belong to granulomatous inflammation. Cellular nodules are formed locally by macrophages that eat silica dust and have granulomatosis. Basic features of inflammatory disease (foreign body granuloma), but lack diagnostic epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells (P81). In short, silicic nodules have some characteristics of granulomatous inflammation in the early stage, but are completely unrelated to granulomatous inflammation in the middle and late stages, while hyaline nodules in the late stages are considered to be typical silicic nodules. Generally speaking, silicic nodules should not be counted as granulomatous inflammation. The textbook seems to imply this. When introducing foreign body granuloma in the ninth edition of pathology P81, it mentions asbestos that can cause pneumoconiosis, but does not mention it. and the more common silica.

Tetrahydrofolate, as a one-carbon unit carrier, participates in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymine nucleotides in the body. When folic acid is lacking, purine nucleotides and thymine nucleotides Synthesis is reduced, DNA synthesis in red blood cells is blocked, cell division and proliferation rate decreases, cell volume increases, and chromatin in the nucleus becomes loose, affecting the maturation of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia (pair B). Folic acid in the body mostly exists in the form of N⁵-methyltetrahydrofolate. When it works, N⁵-methyltetrahydrofolate reacts with homocysteine to form tetrahydrofolate and methionine (Ninth Edition Biochemistry P189). This The reaction needs to be catalyzed by N⁵-methyltetrahydrofolate transmethylase, and vitamin B₁₂ is a coenzyme component of this enzyme. Therefore, when vitamin B₁₂ is lacking, the transmethylation reaction is blocked, affecting the turnover and utilization of tetrahydrofolate, and indirectly affecting thymine. The production of deoxyribonucleotides also affects the maturation of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia (pair C). Pantothenic acid (Ninth Edition Biochemistry P387) is also called pantothenic acid and vitamin B₅. Its active form is coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein (ACP). CoA and ACP constitute the coenzymes of acyltransferase and are widely involved in sugars and lipids. , protein metabolism and liver biotransformation. Pantothenic acid deficiency is rare. Early stages of pantothenic acid deficiency can lead to fatigue and gastrointestinal dysfunction, such as loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, ulcers, constipation and other symptoms. In severe cases, the most significant feature is limb neuralgia syndrome, which mainly manifests as numbness in the toes, shaking when walking, and body aches. If the condition continues to worsen, symptoms such as irritability, bad temper, and insomnia will occur. In short, pantothenic acid deficiency does not cause megaloblastic anemia (False A).

        "Correct Answer": "ACD",
        "Explanation": "The amount of tissue fluid produced is related to the effective filtration pressure. The greater the effective filtration pressure, the more tissue fluid is produced. Effective filtration pressure = the difference between the force that promotes the production of interstitial fluid (capillary blood pressure + interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure) and the force that hinders the production of interstitial fluid (tissue fluid hydrostatic pressure + plasma colloid osmotic pressure). When the right heart fails, venous return is blocked, and thus The capillary inflow into the vein is blocked, causing the capillary blood pressure to increase, the effective filtration pressure to increase, and the production of tissue fluid to increase (D pair). Under normal circumstances, capillaries are almost impermeable to proteins, but when local inflammation (A pair), type I allergic reaction (C pair), etc. occur, the release of a variety of inflammatory mediators increases capillary permeability. Plasma proteins can penetrate into the interstitial fluid from capillaries, causing the plasma colloid osmotic pressure to decrease, the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure to increase, and the effective filtration pressure to increase, resulting in increased interstitial fluid production.

        "Option D": "Decreased renal blood flow",
        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "BD",
        "Explanation": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates urine production through the body's regulation of renin secretion. Renin secretion is regulated by many factors, including intrarenal mechanisms, nervous and humoral mechanisms: ① Intrarenal Mechanism: Intrarenal mechanism refers to the regulation that can be accomplished within the kidney, and its receptors are stretch receptors and macula densa located in the afferent arteriole. The former can sense the perfusion pressure of the renal artery (the degree of stretch on the artery wall), and the latter can sense the amount of Na⁺ in the tubular fluid flowing through the place. When renal blood flow decreases, renal artery perfusion pressure decreases, and the degree of traction on the afferent arteriolar wall is reduced, which stimulates renin release (D pair); conversely, when perfusion pressure increases, renin release decreases. When the glomerular filtration rate decreases or other reasons lead to a decrease in the amount of Na⁺ in the tubular fluid flowing through the macula densa, renin release increases; conversely, when the amount of Na⁺ flowing through the macula densa increases, renin release decreases (C wrong). ②Nervous mechanism: Norepinephrine is released when the renal sympathetic nerves are excited, which acts on the β receptors in the granule cell membrane and can directly stimulate the release of renin (pair B). For example, acute massive blood loss, reduced blood volume, and decreased blood pressure can reflexively excite the renal sympathetic nerves, thereby increasing renin release. ③Humoral mechanism: Catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) in the circulating blood, PGE₂ and PGI₂ produced in the kidneys can stimulate granulosa cells to release renin. Low-salt diet can also significantly increase renin expression levels. Ang II, vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), atrial natriuretic peptide, endothelin and NO can inhibit the release of renin. The decrease in plasma crystal osmotic pressure means that the concentration of Na⁺ in the plasma decreases. When the concentration of Na⁺ in the plasma decreases, the concentration of Na⁺ in the ultrafiltrate also decreases, resulting in a decrease in the amount of Na⁺ in the tubular fluid flowing through the macula densa, causing renin Increased release (pair A).

Heparin has a strong anticoagulant effect, but in the absence of antithrombin (previously called antithrombin III) , the anticoagulant effect of heparin is very weak. Heparin mainly exerts its anticoagulant effect indirectly by enhancing the activity of antithrombin (pair A). The latter is a serine protease inhibitor that can interact with thrombin and thrombin produced by the endogenous coagulation pathway. The serine residues in the active centers of molecules such as FⅨa, FⅩa, FⅪa and FⅫa bind to inhibit their activity. After combining with heparin, their anticoagulant effect can be enhanced by more than 2000 times. However, under normal circumstances, there is almost no heparin in circulating plasma, and antithrombin enhances the anticoagulant function of vascular endothelium mainly by binding to heparan sulfate on the surface of endothelial cells.",

        "Explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is mainly caused by acidic metabolites in ketone bodies. After infusion and insulin treatment, the level of ketone bodies decreases, and the acidosis can be corrected on its own. Generally, there is no need to supplement alkali.

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "ABD",
        "Explanation": "Typical preexcitation syndrome belongs to a dominant atrioventricular accessory pathway. The anatomical basis is that there is a bundle of fibers (bundle of Kent) in the atrioventricular annulus that directly connects the atrium and the ventricle. Sinoatrial node activation or atrial activation can pass through the accessory pathway that conducts quickly. The fibers are transmitted down to pre-excited some ventricular muscles, and at the same time, they are transmitted down through the normal atrioventricular node pathway to excite other parts of the ventricular muscles, forming special electrocardiographic characteristics. The specific manifestations are: ① PR interval shortening <0.12 seconds (A pair); ② QRS wave widening ≥0.12 seconds; ③ The initial part of the QRS complex is rough and blunt, and a pre-shock wave (delta wave) appears (B pair); ④ The P-J interval is generally normal; ⑤ Secondary ST-T changes occur, which are related to the main QRS complex. The wave direction is opposite (D pair). At the same time, it should be noted that the size of the delta wave, the width of the QRS wave and the degree of ST-T change are related to the amount of preexcitation component, while the QT interval depends on the change of the QRS wave (delta wave) Is it proportional to the secondary changes in ST-T? If the changes are proportional, the QT interval can be normal. If it is disproportionate, the QT interval may be prolonged (C). QT prolongation does exist clinically, but it cannot be used as a Electrocardiographic features of typical preexcitation syndrome.",

        "Explanation": "The main function of the heart is to pump blood. The clinical evaluation of the heart's pumping function is cardiac function evaluation, which can be divided into cardiac ejection function evaluation and cardiac diastolic function evaluation. Echocardiography (B pair) examination is one of the common methods for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. It can calculate left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVDs), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDs), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), Ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular shortening fractions (LVFs), among which left ventricular ejection fraction is the preferred index to evaluate left ventricular systolic function in most patients. By calculating the ejection period ventricular The rate of change of volume and the rate of change of ventricular diameter can reflect changes in ventricular contractility, and are currently the most commonly used and important methods for non-invasive evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function. Echocardiography can intuitively reflect the structural shape of the heart and great blood vessels, display their physiological activities in real time, and dynamically evaluate cardiac function. It has the advantages of non-invasiveness, repeatability, price advantage, and bedside detection. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (C pair) is widely used in ischemic heart disease or non-ischemic heart disease such as cardiomyopathy. It can non-invasively directly display the location, scope and extent of myocardial lesions, which is convenient and simple. , safe and effective. Its most important clinical application value is to combine with stress test to evaluate ischemic heart disease. It can reflect the hemodynamic and functional changes of coronary artery stenosis and provide important prognostic information. Its principle is to use normal Myocardial cells or functional myocardial cells absorb imaging agents injected through the coronary arteries to display myocardial images. The images of diseased myocardium are sparse or defective. Dynamic electrocardiogram (A error) is used qualitatively and quantitatively in arrhythmia detection, and is widely used to detect myocardial ischemia, screen high-risk patients for arrhythmias that may occur after myocardial infarction, and provide a reliable basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment. ECG is directly It reflects the bioelectrical changes during the generation, conduction and recovery of cardiac excitement. It can indirectly reflect the changes in cardiac anatomy, metabolism, ions and hemodynamics. It is the gold standard for diagnosing arrhythmia and also for diagnosing other cardiac diseases. The key or important indicator of the disease is also an important observation indicator of the efficacy of treatment. Coronary angiography (D-A) is the traditional \"gold standard\" for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It is still the most commonly used imaging examination method to determine whether there is coronary artery disease and to designate treatment plans accordingly. However, it can only It reflects the blood vessel itself and cannot reflect the local blood perfusion of the myocardium and the activity of myocardial cells.",

On cardiac percussion, the areas of dullness increase to both sides (pair B), both of which are absolute dullness areas. Cardiac tamponade results in restricted ventricular diastole, decreased stroke volume, decreased systolic blood pressure, and slowed blood flow. Therefore, the blood remaining in the aorta at the end of diastole decreases less, and diastolic blood pressure may decrease or remain unchanged. Systolic blood pressure decreases, while diastolic blood pressure does not change much, so pulse pressure decreases (C wrong).

        "Correct Answer": "AC",
        "Explanation": "The vestibular organ of the inner ear is composed of the semicircular canals, the utricle and the saccule. The semicircular canals are angular acceleration receptors, and the utricle and saccule are linear acceleration receptors. There are three semicircular canals on both sides of the human inner ear: the upper, outer and posterior semicircular canals. The outer semicircular canal is also called the horizontal semicircular canal, and the upper semicircular canal is also called the anterior semicircular canal. The three semicircular canals are perpendicular to each other and represent the three planes of the three-dimensional space. When the human body is upright and rotates around the longitudinal axis of the body (horizontal plane), the horizontal (outer) semicircular canals are most stimulated; when the human body is turned sideways (rotating around the sagittal axis in the coronal plane), the upper (front) canals are most stimulated. Semicircular canals; when the human body is turned forward and backward (rotated in the sagittal plane around the coronal axis), the posterior semicircular canals are most stimulated. When the semicircular canals are stimulated too strongly or for too long, it can cause autonomic nervous system dysfunction related to the vestibular nerve, leading to increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, etc. Seasickness is caused by the bumping of the ship when the ship is traveling at sea.

        "Explanation": "Hyperkalemia has the risk of causing the patient's heart to suddenly stop, so active treatment is required once diagnosed. The treatment methods are mainly summarized as follows: 1. Stop the use of all potassium ion-containing drugs; 2. Intravenous injection of 5% sodium bicarbonate; 3. Use glucose solution and insulin (also known as \"polarizing solution\"); 4. Oral administration of cations Exchange resin; 5. For those whose serum potassium is higher than 6.5mmol/L or the above potassium-lowering treatments are ineffective, dialysis treatment can be used to quickly lower potassium; 6. Slow intravenous injection of 20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate can be used to antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of high potassium. Fights arrhythmias. First aid for hyperkalemia is knowledge that clinicians must master. The effects of intravenous injection of 5% sodium bicarbonate are: ① The injected hypertonic solution can increase blood volume and dilute serum K⁺ (pair A); ② The alkalemia caused by the injection of sodium bicarbonate solution can promote K⁺ Move into the cells and reduce the concentration of extracellular K⁺; ③ Increase the Na⁺ content in the renal distal tubule, increase the exchange of Na⁺ and K⁺, make K⁺ excreted in the urine, and reduce acidosis (B pair).

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "BCD",
        "Explanation": "When the mixed venous blood flows through the pulmonary capillaries, the blood PO₂ is 40mmHg, which is lower than the 102mmHg of the alveolar air. O₂ is net diffused from the alveolar air to the blood under the action of the partial pressure difference, causing the blood PO₂ to gradually rise, and finally approaches the level of the alveolar air. PO₂, this diffusion process does not involve the participation of biological mechanisms and does not require metabolic energy consumption. It is a passive diffusion process (C pair), also called simple diffusion (P17). During maximum inspiration, the trachea and bronchi also expand along with the lungs, and the volume of the anatomical dead space (dead space) increases (pair D). Option A of this question is slightly controversial. VA/Q of 0.84 is alveolar ventilation per minute, not pulmonary ventilation per minute. Because of the existence of dead space, pulmonary ventilation per minute may be greater than pulmonary capillary blood per minute. Flow. 9th Edition Physiology P89: If the heart rate is 75 beats/min and the stroke volume is 70ml, the cardiac output is approximately 5L/min. Generally, the cardiac output of a healthy adult male at rest is 4.5~6.0L, min. The cardiac output of women is about 10% lower than that of men of the same weight. Pulmonary capillary blood flow per minute and cardiac output are equal in value, so it is also known that pulmonary ventilation per minute is greater than pulmonary capillary blood flow per minute (pair A).

        "Option E": "",
        "Correct Answer": "ACD",
        "Explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the hyperglycemic crises and one of the acute complications of diabetes. The pathophysiological changes caused by it can be reversed with timely treatment. The main cause of the disease is the severe lack of insulin. , therefore the rational use of insulin is the key to treatment. Generally, a low-dose insulin treatment plan is used, which can not only effectively inhibit the production of ketone bodies, but also avoid various risks caused by rapid decline in blood sugar, blood potassium, and plasma osmotic pressure (wrong B) . At the same time, rehydration therapy is very critical for DKA patients. It can not only correct water loss and restore renal perfusion, but also help reduce blood sugar and eliminate ketone bodies. The rehydration rate should be fast first and then slow. If there are no symptoms of heart failure, replenishment should be faster in the early stage. blood volume, improve peripheral circulation and renal function (pair A). Hyponatremia and hypochloremia can generally be corrected through rehydration during treatment. However, in patients with DKA, the K⁺ deficiency is severe and the serum K⁺ concentration varies. After insulin and rehydration treatment, the K⁺ deficiency can be aggravated. Therefore, at the beginning After insulin and fluid rehydration treatment, K⁺ should be started under ECG monitoring and serum potassium monitoring. The principle of potassium supplementation is: if the blood potassium is lower than normal before treatment, potassium supplementation should be started immediately; if the blood potassium is normal and the urine output is >40ml/h , also start potassium supplementation immediately (pair C); if the serum potassium is normal and the urine output is <30ml/h, potassium supplementation will be postponed until the urine output increases; if the serum potassium is higher than normal, potassium supplementation will be postponed. After patients with mild to moderate DKA receive the above treatment, acidosis can be recovered with the correction of metabolic disorders. However, in severe acidosis, appropriate alkali supplementation treatment is required. The indications for alkali supplementation are: blood pH <7.1, HCO₃⁻< 5mmol/L. Other treatments for ketoacidosis include: treatment of shock, heart failure and arrhythmias, treatment of cerebral edema, treatment of acute kidney injury, and treatment of other comorbidities and complications.",

        "Correct Answer": "ABCD",
        "Explanation": "Increased portal vein pressure increases the effective filtration pressure of the portal vein capillary bed, reduces tissue fluid recovery and leaks into the abdominal cavity to form ascites (A pair). When cirrhotic nodules cause obstruction in the liver sinusoids and retrosinusoids, the production of intrahepatic lymph increases, but the return is not smooth, and a large amount of intrahepatic lymph leaks from the surface of the liver capsule into the abdominal cavity (pair B). However, the main reason for the formation of ascites is the damage of liver function, which reduces the synthesis of plasma albumin, causing the reduction of plasma colloid osmotic pressure (C pair), which promotes plasma extravasation. In portal hypertension, a large amount of fluid leaks out, but the central blood flow is reduced, which subsequently stimulates excessive secretion of aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention and aggravating the formation of ascites. In addition, decreased liver function reduces the decomposition of aldosterone secreted by the adrenal cortex and antidiuretic hormone released by the neuropituitary gland in the liver, and increases the blood level, which promotes the reabsorption of sodium and water by the renal tubules, thus causing sodium and water retention (D pair ).",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Drop in blood pressure is one of the typical manifestations of shock. However, in the early stage of shock, due to the body's compensatory effect (sympathetic-adrenal axis excitement leads to the release of a large amount of catecholamines, and increased renin-angiotensin secretion, etc.), the heartbeat can be accelerated. Increased cardiac output to maintain relatively stable circulatory capacity; selective contraction of peripheral and visceral small blood vessels to redistribute circulating blood volume and ensure effective perfusion of important organs such as the heart and brain), causing blood pressure to actually decrease although there is no significant decrease. Shock already exists, so blood pressure is not the most sensitive indicator to reflect the degree of shock (A is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question). Pulse rate/systolic blood pressure (mmHg) is commonly used to calculate the shock index. An index of more than 0.5 indicates no shock; an index of >1.0 to 1.5 indicates shock; and an index of >2.0 indicates severe shock (pair B). Skin temperature and color are a sign of body surface perfusion. For example, if the nail is gently pressed, temporary local ischemia will appear pale. If the color quickly returns to normal after the pressure is released, it indicates that peripheral circulation has been restored and the shock has improved (pair C). After recovering from shock, the blood pressure is normal and the urine output is generally normal.

        "Explanation": "Conditions for the occurrence of hemorrhagic infarction: ① Severe congestion (pair B): When the organ has severe congestion, the infarction caused by vascular obstruction is hemorrhagic infarction, such as pulmonary congestion. Severe congestion is a prerequisite for the formation of pulmonary infarction, because when the left heart function declines, congestion occurs in the lungs, and the internal pressure of the pulmonary veins and capillaries increases. Once the pulmonary artery is blocked, the original pulmonary congestion affects the effective blood supply of the bronchial and bronchial arteries, causing the lungs to be damaged. Infarction occurs. Because the infarct tissue is loose and blood enters the alveoli, pulmonary infarction is a hemorrhagic infarction. ② Loose tissue (pair D): The tissues of the intestine and lung are relatively loose. The loose tissue gaps in the early stage of infarction can accommodate a large amount of leaked blood. When the tissue necrosis absorbs water and swells, the leaked blood cannot be squeezed out of the infarction focus. Therefore, the infarct is hemorrhagic. ③ Arterial obstruction is accompanied by venous obstruction: such as ovarian torsion and intestinal volvulus. When the arterial blood supply stops, the venous return is also blocked, and blood leaks from the congested capillaries, forming hemorrhagic infarction. ④Double blood supply (Pair C): Hemorrhagic infarction occurs when parallel blood flow from unobstructed vessels can enter the necrotic area, but this perfusion is not enough to compensate for local ischemia. The ninth edition of pathology believes that the conditions for the occurrence of hemorrhagic infarction are severe congestion and loose tissue.

Dry and wet rales can be heard in both lungs during physical examination. It is considered that the patient is in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. . Blood gas analysis: pH7.28 (normal pH value is 7.35~7.45) decreased, PaO₂52mmHg＜60mmHg, PaCO₂76mmHg˃50mmHg, diagnosed as type II respiratory failure. For type II respiratory failure caused by COPD, attention should be paid to maintaining a low concentration of oxygen during oxygen therapy, with the concentration <35%. The data given in the option option of this question is 33% (pair C) to prevent the blood oxygen content from being too high and losing the response to hypoxia. Stimulation of the respiratory center. COPD is due to airway obstruction and insufficient alveolar ventilation, leading to CO₂ retention. Therefore, non-invasive mechanical ventilation treatment (pair A) should be performed to improve ventilation. The use of sodium bicarbonate in acidosis can increase the production of H₂CO₃, which decomposes and can aggravate CO₂ retention. CO₂ retention in chronic respiratory failure is a chronic process, and the body often compensates by increasing alkali reserves to maintain a high level of bicarbonate. To maintain pH stability, administration of sodium bicarbonate can increase the HCO₃⁻ content. When ventilation is improved and respiratory acidosis is quickly corrected, the bicarbonate level cannot be reduced immediately, and metabolic alkalosis is prone to occur (B error). The patient heard dry and wet rales in both lungs, indicating that the airway was blocked by secretions. When using respiratory stimulants (nicosamide and lobeline), the airway must be kept open, otherwise the respiratory muscles will be stimulated.

        "Explanation": "When the excitation of the presynaptic neuron is transmitted to the terminal, the presynaptic membrane depolarizes. When the depolarization reaches a certain level, the voltage-gated calcium channel in the presynaptic membrane opens, and Ca²⁺ enters the synapse from outside the cell. In the axoplasm of the pretactile terminal, the Ca²⁺ concentration in the axoplasm increases instantaneously. Ca²⁺ combines with calmodulin in the axoplasm to form a Ca²⁺-CaM complex, so the Ca²⁺-CaM-dependent protein kinase II is activated. Promote the phosphorylation of synapsin I, weakening its binding force with cytoskeletal filaments, and synaptic vesicles are released from the cytoskeletal filaments (P301). It can be seen that the degree of phosphorylation of synaptic protein I depends on the amount of Ca²⁺ entering the presynaptic membrane (B error). The amount of Ca²⁺ entering the presynaptic membrane is the most important factor affecting the amount of transmitter release from the presynaptic membrane (C right). The amount of transmitter released is related to the frequency and amplitude of the action potential arriving at the synaptic terminal (affecting the amount of Ca²⁺ entering the premembrane), but has nothing to do with the conduction speed of the action potential (A is wrong).

The pressed skin becomes necrotic due to ischemia and hypoxia, forming pressure sores or bedsores (Pair A), which most commonly occur in the sacrum and femur. Greater trochanter, iliac crest and heel. The S₂~S₄ segment of the spinal cord is the spinal cord reflex center for urination. In paraplegic patients with spinal cord injuries above the cone, the external urethral sphincter loses high-level innervation and cannot relax voluntarily, resulting in urinary retention. In patients with cone damage, the pudendal nerve center is damaged, and the external urethral sphincter is damaged. The sphincter relaxes and urinary incontinence occurs. These urinary disorders all lead to the reduction of the patient's natural defense ability of the urinary tract, which can easily cause urinary system infection (pair B). Paraplegic patients have damaged sympathetic nerves and lost balance with the parasympathetic nervous system. The skin's perspiration and temperature regulation functions are lost. They cannot dissipate heat through sweating in summer, causing high fever (C pair). In winter, they can also suffer from hypothermia due to the loss of temperature regulation function. In patients with high paraplegia, the intercostal respiratory muscles are paralyzed. If the injury reaches C₄ or above, the diaphragm is also paralyzed. Due to insufficient respiratory muscle strength, breathing is very laborious, which increases the resistance of the respiratory tract and makes it difficult to discharge secretions, which can easily cause dyspnea, respiratory infection, and even respiratory failure. However, paraplegia generally does not involve the cardiovascular system (D pair).",

Patients on a low-sugar diet have enhanced fat mobilization and increased ketone body production. Lack of succinyl-CoA transsulfurase will lead to ketone body utilization disorders and ketonemia (pair A). There is a complete set of mechanisms for finely regulating sugar metabolism in the normal human body. Blood sugar levels will not continue to rise during high-sugar meals, and hypoglycemia will not occur during low-sugar meals (False C). Hypoglycemia is mostly caused by sugar metabolism disorders (P110 ). Hyperlipidemia (P170) (B error) is often caused by disorders of plasma lipoprotein metabolism.

        "Explanation": "In this case, esophageal variceal bleeding caused by liver cirrhosis was large and violent, and a state of hemorrhagic shock had developed. The first choice of treatment measures was emergency blood transfusion and fluid infusion (pair C). Emergency endoscopic hemostasis (A error) is currently an important means of treating esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding. Generally, after the shock is corrected and the patient's basic condition is stabilized, emergency endoscopy is performed and treated at the same time. Exploratory laparotomy (B error) is selected only when the bleeding site is unknown and other methods such as a large amount of hemostatic drugs are difficult to effectively stop the bleeding. Three-lumen two-capsule tube compression (False D) has a certain hemostatic effect, but the disadvantage is that the patient suffers a lot and has many complications (such as aspiration pneumonia, suffocation, esophagitis, esophageal mucosal necrosis, arrhythmia, etc.). Since long-term compression cannot be performed, it is necessary to stop The early rebleeding rate after use is high. Balloon compression is currently not recommended as the first choice hemostatic measure, but is used temporarily when drug treatment is ineffective for major bleeding.",

        "Correct Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Ras protein (P333) has the same guanylate binding site and GTPase activity as the trimeric G protein, but the protein has only one polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 21kDa, which is smaller than the G protein, so it is also called a low molecular weight G protein or Small G protein. Ras protein is a signaling molecule in the tyrosine kinase receptor (PTK) signaling pathway. The tyrosine kinase receptor is an enzyme-linked receptor and has tyrosine kinase activity itself. When the tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligand After (growth factor) binding, autophosphorylation occurs, and the phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptor sequentially binds to the growth factor binding protein Grb2 (growth factor binding protein 2) (B pair), guanylate exchange factor SOS (Son of Sevenless) ) (C pair) and Ras protein, promote the Ras protein to release GDP and bind to GTP (A pair) to be activated. The activated Ras protein then activates MAPKKK and downstream signaling pathways (Ras→MAPKKK→MAPKK→MAPK). Guanylyl cyclase (GC) (Ninth Edition of Physiology P30), also known as guanylyl cyclase receptor, belongs to the same enzyme-linked receptor as tyrosine kinase receptor, and interacts with ligands (atrial natriuretic peptide, After brain natriuretic peptide) is combined, it can catalyze the generation of the second messenger cGMP, which has nothing to do with the activity of Ras protein (D is wrong, which is the correct answer to this question).",

        "Correct Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Arterial blood enters the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole for filtration, and then flows out of the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole. When blood is filtered through the glomerulus, a certain amount of pressure is required to filter out the original urine. ACEI and ARB drugs have the effect of dilating glomerular arteries, but the dilation of efferent arterioles is stronger than the dilation of afferent arterioles, resulting in a decrease in glomerular effective filtration pressure, causing a further decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and renal insufficiency. Functional deterioration. In addition, patients with renal insufficiency have high blood potassium, and ACEI and ARB drugs have a potassium-sparing effect, which will further increase serum potassium after use. Severe hyperkalemia can easily cause cardiac electrophysiological disorders, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Arrest. Therefore, patients with chronic renal insufficiency cannot use ACEI drugs such as benazepril (A pair) or ARB drugs such as Losartan (B pair) when the serum creatinine is greater than 264 μmol/L.
